# Līdza guide for thura

Written by `lidza new`. One source of truth for every agent working here;
`AGENTS.md` points at this file (`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are the
line `@AGENTS.md`, which Claude Code and Gemini CLI expand; Codex reads
`AGENTS.md` itself).

## What this is

A Līdza app is one Go binary. In production it serves the API under `/api`
and the built frontend for every other path: a file the build lacks
(`/robots.txt`, a stale hashed asset) is a 404, and any other path is a
client-side route. In development, `lidza dev`
runs the same binary with the frontend proxied from its dev server, so the
app is always at one address: http://127.0.0.1:3000.

### The app in its own package (`appDir`)

At the root, the app is package `main`, which Go cannot import: its tests
live next to `routes.go`. To keep them in their own directory, move the
app into an importable package and name it in `lidza.json`:

1. Move `start.go`, `routes.go`, `tools.go` and the other files of the
   root package except `main.go` into `app/`, with `package app`. The
   function that builds the `lidza.App` becomes `func New(dist fs.FS)
   lidza.App` in `app/app.go`.
2. `main.go` keeps the embed and runs it:
   `func main() { lidza.Run(app.New(lidza.Sub(dist, "dist"))) }`.
3. Add `"appDir": "app"` to `lidza.json` and run `lidza gen`: `packs.go`
   is generated into `app/` (delete the root one). `lidza gen resource`
   registers routes in `app/routes.go` and `lidza mcp` reads
   `app/tools.go`.
4. A directory a moved file embeds moves with it (`//go:embed admin` in
   `routes.go`: `app/admin/`; the i18n pack's catalogs: `app/locales/`).
5. Tests go in `tests/` (`package tests`) and start the app with
   `srv := lidzatest.Start(t, app.New(nil))`; `lidza test` runs them.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lidza dev` | starts the frontend dev server (http://127.0.0.1:5173), builds and runs the app on http://127.0.0.1:3000, rebuilds on Go changes. `npm install` runs automatically when `node_modules` is missing. |
| `lidza build` | builds the frontend into `dist/` (routes without parameters prerendered to static HTML), then compiles `bin/thura`: one binary, no Node at runtime. |
| `lidza check --json` | regenerates, then runs `go vet`, `staticcheck`, `cargo check` and `tsc`; prints one JSON list of diagnostics, each with `layer`, `file`, `line`, `message`. Exit 1 while there are errors. A frontend call that no longer matches a handler fails here. |
| `lidza gen` | `schema.lidza` to `schema/schema.go`, `db/schema.sql`, a migration in `db/migrations` when models changed; handlers to `.lidza/openapi.json` and the client in `.lidza/client`. `lidza dev` runs it on every change. |
| `lidza context` | writes `.lidza/context.json`: routes, handler signatures, Rust exports. |
| `lidza mcp` | MCP server on stdio; see "Agent interface". |
| `lidza gen resource <Model> [--public \| --shared]` | queries, `Create/Update/<Model>List` types, `handlers/<table>.go` with list, get, create, patch, delete under `/api/v1/<plural>` (the list with search, filters, a date range, sorting and pages through `list.Read`: recipe "Add a paginated, filterable list"), registered in `routes.go` (in `appDir` when set) behind `auth.Require()`. An owned model (`ownerId`, or a field with `@ref(User)`) is scoped to the signed-in user. `--public` marks the model `@public`: open routes, no owner. `--shared` marks it `@shared`: behind sign-in, rows not scoped. Needs the `db` and `auth` packs (`auth` not with `--public`). |
| `lidza update [--migrate]` | brings the app's branch and the framework up to date together: a branch behind its upstream is pulled first when that is a clean fast-forward (nothing uncommitted, no local commits the upstream lacks), otherwise the update stops and says what to run (`--no-pull` stops instead of pulling); then the CLI and this app's framework module move to the newest release (never back to an older one; `--to <commit>` takes a release not tagged yet), it regenerates, refreshes the deployment files, then runs `lidza install`. It stops when the files it rewrites have uncommitted changes (`git stash push` sets them aside); `--commit` commits the update when done. In a team, one person makes the update and merges it; the others `git pull`, then `lidza update --cli-only`. |
| `lidza gen deploy [--force]` | the `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` and `deploy/thura.service` from the current templates; a file the app changed is kept and named unless `--force`. |
| `lidza pack add <name>` | enables an official pack: `db`, `auth`, `jobs`, `mail`, `llm`, `storage`, `cache`, `i18n`, `realtime`, `analytics`, `geo`, `media`. |
| `lidza credentials set NAME=value` | seals a secret into `config/credentials.yml.enc` with `config/master.key`; `list` (names), `show` (every value, decrypted) or `show NAME`, `edit` (the whole file in `$EDITOR`), `unset`, `init`. |
| `lidza admin add EMAIL...` | lets these users (emails or ids) open `/admin` besides the first account: `ADMIN_USERS` in the sealed credentials, read within seconds; in production after a commit and deploy of `config/credentials.yml.enc`. Admins added on the Users page, in the file and in the environment all count. `remove`, `list`. |
| `lidza brief [--all] [--list]` | the kickoff interview in a terminal: the open questions of `docs/brief.md` one by one, each with suggestions to pick by number or your own answer; `--all` goes through every question, `--list` prints them. `lidza brief answer <id> "..."` records one; `lidza brief skip [id...]` skips questions for good (no ids: every open one), and `s` or `S` in the interview skips one or the rest. |
| `lidza note add "..."` | a lasting fact about this app in the agent files' Team notes, shared through git. |
| `lidza test [-v] [--run Regexp] [--fresh] [go test flags]` | creates and migrates the `.env.test` database (`--fresh` drops and recreates it first, after a migration from another branch), runs `go test ./...` with `LIDZA_MODE=test`, then the frontend check. Tests never see the master key or a variable named like one of the app's credentials: they run on `.env.test` and the test providers; a test that needs a key sets `LIDZA_MASTER_KEY` itself. |
| `lidza test --e2e [--install]` | builds the app, starts the binary with `.env.test`, runs the Playwright suite in `e2e/`; `--install` fetches the browser when missing. The sign-in and analytics rate limits are raised for the run (every account signs up from 127.0.0.1) unless `.env.test` sets them; the Go tests keep the real limits. Rows the suite needs that no page creates (data a sync job would fetch) go in `e2e/seed.sql`, loaded into the test database before each run; write it to be rerun (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). |
| `lidza install [--packs db,auth,mail] [--agent claude]` | on an existing app: enables the packs (db added when one needs it), writes `.env` from `.env.example` with a random `AUTH_SECRET` and the app's database, writes `.env.test`, generates, creates and migrates the dev and test databases, installs `node_modules`, installs the agent CLI when asked, makes the first commit. On a clone or after a pull it adds to `.env` what packs enabled since need and applies new migrations; one that drops data (`-- review: data loss`) waits for `--migrate`. `lidza new --packs ...` runs it for a new app; `lidza setup` is its former name. Rerunning is safe. |
| `lidza ship [--domains a.example.com] [--email ops@example.com] [--no-e2e]` | before a deploy: `lidza verify`, the browser suite against the built binary, the production build, `deploy/production.env`; stops at the first failure. Then it names the settings the enabled packs need in production that neither the credentials nor `deploy.env` hold, or hold with a development-only value (`CACHE_URL`, `APP_URL`, `LLM_PROVIDER=fake`). The app's production settings that are not secrets (`MAIL_PROVIDER`, `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_PREFIX`) go in `lidza.json` under `deploy.env`, which ship writes into `deploy/production.env` on every run; a name that looks like a secret there is refused. |
| `lidza verify [--json] [--no-test] [--allow-test-changes]` | before a commit: regenerates and requires the generated files to be staged, refuses staged changes that weaken the tests, runs the checks, runs the Go tests. The pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` runs it (`git commit --no-verify` skips once; `lidza verify --install-hook` sets it up again). The test guard compares the staged changes with `HEAD` and names each file and line that deletes a test file (`*_test.go`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts(x)`), adds `t.Skip`, `t.Skipf`, `t.SkipNow`, `test.skip`, `it.skip`, `describe.skip`, `.only` or `.fixme`, or removes more assertions (`t.Error`, `t.Fatal`, `expect(`, `assert.`) from a file than it adds, or swaps an assertion's matcher for a looser one (`toBe` to `toBeTruthy`, `assert.Equal` to `assert.NotNil`). An assertion whose expected text changes and nothing else (a copy update: `'Security'` to `'Sign-in security'`) passes, and the verify report lists each one, old and new, for the developer to see. A deliberate change is confirmed with `LIDZA_ALLOW_TEST_CHANGES=1 git commit ...` (or `lidza verify --allow-test-changes`); one skip with a stated reason passes with a `// lidza:allow-skip <reason>` comment on its line or the line above. A test is never weakened to make it pass: if it is wrong, the agent says so and the developer confirms. |
| `lidza gen llms [--force]` | writes a starting `llms.txt` (llmstxt.org) for visiting agents: the app's name as the H1, a summary to write, a link per page the last build prerendered by its title. It goes in `public/` (`static/` in the htmx template) and is served at `/llms.txt` as text. It is public content: what an agent needs to use the site, never the guides, handlers, routes or configuration. Without it `/llms.txt` is a 404. |
| `lidza audit layout [--viewport 1440x900,390x844] [--theme light,dark] [--routes /a,/b] [--max-scroll -1] [--stability 6s [--trigger JS] [--allow SELECTORS]] [--base-url URL] [--storage-state FILE \| --login FILE] [--json]` | builds and starts the app on the test database (as `lidza test --e2e`), visits every page the build prerenders plus `--routes`, signed in as a throwaway user when the auth pack runs, at each viewport and theme, and reports what scrolls: sideways is a fault (the elements past the edge are named), down is a fault past `--max-scroll` pixels (`-1`, the default, only reports it; an app whose design says no page scrolls sets `0`). Containers that scroll on their own (a wide table in its wrapper) are listed with their sizes, never a fault. `--stability 6s` scrolls them, runs `--trigger` (a refresh call) or waits, and faults one a re-render reset or that lost the focus inside it; a log that follows its tail on purpose is named in `--allow` or carries `data-audit-follow`. `--base-url` audits an app already running (any Go app with Playwright in `node_modules`), signed in with `--storage-state` (a Playwright storage state) or `--login` (a module whose default export, `async (page, baseURL)`, signs in). A hash route is a same-document navigation, without an HTTP status. Exits non-zero on a fault. The same checks for specs: `expectNoSidewaysScroll(page)` and `expectFitsViewport(page)` from `e2e/layout.ts`. |
| `lidza audit performance [--samples 3] [--budget lcp=2500,js=300kb] [--routes /a] [--base-url URL] [--json]` | builds and starts the app and loads every prerendered page plus `--routes` cold on a throttled phone (Lighthouse's mobile settings), `--samples` times, reporting the median FCP, LCP, CLS and TBT, the bytes downloaded by kind and the JavaScript that does not run on load. A page over a budget is a fault: sizes and layout shift by default (`cls=0.1`, `js=300kb`, `css=100kb`, `images=1000kb`, `total=1600kb`), timings only when set (`--budget fcp=1800,lcp=2500,tbt=200`, in ms), since they vary between machines; the advice is not: uncompressed text, assets cached briefly, images larger than drawn ("Add a responsive image") or without a size, a lazy LCP image, a missing title, `lang`, viewport or description, and an `llms.txt` served as HTML. Gate on timings with more `--samples`, and set budgets for the app's own pages. A hydrating page's TBT falls to zero as a static page ("Add a page"). |
| `lidza doctor` | toolchain, services, `node_modules`, pack builds, e2e browser; each missing item with its fix. |
| `lidza pack scaffold <name>` | creates `packs/<name>` with a crate and an example capability; `lidza pack build` compiles it. |
| `lidza db migrate\|rollback\|status [--production]`, `lidza db new "<description>"` | applies `db/migrations` (db pack, `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`); `new` writes a hand-written (data) migration that `lidza gen` never touches. `migrate` and `rollback` refuse a database on another host (not a Unix socket, `localhost` or a loopback address) unless `--production` is given; the MCP tools never pass it. |
| `lidza benchmark [--vus 500] [--duration 1m]` | runs `benchmarks/scale_test.js` with k6 against the running app; heap and goroutines must stay flat. |
| `lidza version` | prints the framework version. |
| `go test ./...` | Go tests. |
| `npm run check` | frontend type check and lint (`tsc --noEmit && eslint src`; `jsx-a11y` violations are errors). |


## Agent interface

`.mcp.json` (Claude Code), `.gemini/settings.json` (Gemini CLI) and
`.codex/config.toml` (Codex, once the project is trusted) start
`lidza mcp` for this project; `lidza gen` writes one an app lacks. Every command of the CLI is a tool, so an
agent needs no shell here. Its tools:

| Tool | Returns |
|---|---|
| `lidza_routes` | the API routes with handler name, file, line and signature |
| `lidza_context` | the whole project as JSON (same as `.lidza/context.json`) |
| `lidza_check` | the diagnostics of `lidza check --json` |
| `lidza_logs` | the last lines of the `lidza dev` output (`lines`, `filter`) |
| `lidza_config` | `lidza.json` |
| `lidza_gen`, `lidza_gen_resource` (`model`, `force`), `lidza_pack_add` (`name`), `lidza_pack_scaffold`, `lidza_pack_build`, `lidza_db_migrate`, `lidza_db_rollback`, `lidza_db_status`, `lidza_test` (`e2e`, `install`, `run`, `verbose`), `lidza_verify` (`no_test`), `lidza_build`, `lidza_ship` (`domains`, `email`, `no_e2e`), `lidza_doctor` | the CLI command of the same name run for you, in this project: one JSON result with `ok`, `exit`, the parsed `report` (check, verify) or the `output`. Prefer these over a shell. |
| `lidza_recipes`, `lidza_recipe_add` | the recipes with their scope; record one of this app's conventions (title, description, steps) |
| `lidza_decision_add` | record why the app is built a way (a pack, Rust, a dependency, a schema tradeoff) in `docs/decisions.md`; `lidza://decisions` reads the log |
| `lidza_brief` (`open_only`), `lidza_brief_answer` (`id`, `answer`), `lidza_brief_skip` (`ids`), `lidza_note_add` (`text`) | the brief: its questions with suggestions and answers, one answer recorded and applied (a decision, the working agreements, the palette, a seeded recipe); a lasting fact in the Team notes. `lidza://brief` reads `docs/brief.md` |
| `lidza_credentials_set`, `lidza_credentials_list` | seal secrets into `config/credentials.yml.enc` by their environment names; list the names |
| `lidza_mail`, `lidza_llm`, `lidza_llm_usage`, `lidza_storage`, `lidza_errors` | with the pack enabled: the outbox; a prompt against the configured model; token usage; stored objects; captured errors |
| `lidza_api` | the framework's public Go API: one `package`, or a `filter` across all; without either, the package list; also the resource `lidza://api/{package}` |
| `lidza_snippet` | a file of the reference app, verified by its tests (`name`: `schema`, `routes`, `auth-handlers`, `resource-handlers`, `queries`, `handler-test`, `mcp-tool`, `page`, `browser-test`); also `lidza snippet` |
| `lidza_errors` | captured errors (analytics pack) |

Its prompts are the recipes of this guide (`add-api-route`,
`add-resource`, ...). The same recipes are skills for Claude Code
(`.claude/skills/`), and for Codex and Gemini CLI (`.agents/skills/`,
invoked as `$add-api-route` in Codex and `/add-api-route` in Gemini);
`lidza gen` rewrites them from this file.

The app adds its own tools in `tools.go` with
`lidza.ToolFunc("name", "what it does", func(ctx, In) (Out, error))`;
they appear as `app_name` in `lidza mcp` (running inside the app, with
its packs) and, when the binary runs with `LIDZA_MCP_TOKEN`, at `/mcp`
for other agents. Give a tool a `schema.lidza` type as `In` and its rules
are enforced.

While `lidza dev` runs, http://127.0.0.1:3000/_lidza/llms.txt summarizes
the app and http://127.0.0.1:3000/_lidza/llms-full.txt has this guide plus
every handler signature. Both are regenerated after each Go rebuild. They
are also at /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt until the app serves its own
there (a product's llms.txt for crawlers), which then wins.

The lists are live: a pack added to `lidza.json`, a recipe recorded in
the guide or a tool added to `tools.go` appears in this server's tools
and prompts within seconds, and at once after `lidza_pack_add` and
`lidza_recipe_add`; no restart. Only a newer CLI binary (`lidza update`)
needs the server reconnected (`/mcp` in Claude Code), and every command
result says so while that is the case.

## Rules

1. Go owns `/api`. The frontend never defines an API route and never proxies
   one; it calls `/api/...` on the same origin.
2. Add an API route in `routes.go` with `router.Route(r, "GET /api/v1/things/{id}", handler)`
   where `handler` is `func(ctx context.Context, req *router.Request[In]) (Out, error)`.
   `In` is the JSON body type (`router.None` without one) and `Out` the reply
   (`router.None` for 204). Put the shapes in `schema.lidza` so they get
   validation and reach the client. Return `router.NotFound("thing")` or
   `router.Errorf(status, ...)` for client-visible errors, or
   `router.ErrorCode(status, "code", ...)` when a client must tell two
   errors of one status apart (it reads `err.code`); any other error is a
   500 whose text stays on the server. Keep handlers under `/api/v1/`.
3. Name handlers: the name becomes the client method (`listPosts` gives
   `api.listPosts()`).
4. The frontend calls the API only through `@lidza/client` (`api.<name>`),
   never `fetch` by hand. The client is regenerated from the handlers; after
   changing a handler's types, `lidza check` shows what the frontend must adapt.
5. Never edit `dist/`, `schema/` or `.lidza/`; they are generated.
6. Do not run the frontend dev server or the Go binary by hand; `lidza dev`
   starts both and keeps them in sync.
7. Keep the app stateless: no global mutable maps, no in-memory sessions.
   State goes to Postgres or Redis.
8. Log with `lidza.Log(ctx).Info("what happened", "key", value)`: the line
   carries the request id, so one request's lines are found together.
   Never `fmt.Println` in handlers.
9. Before calling a framework function, read its signature: `lidza api
   <package> [--filter name]` or the MCP tool `lidza_api` with one
   package (`packs/llm`), or a filter alone to search every package by
   name; without either, the package list. Never render them all
   (`all`): thousands of lines every later turn carries. `lidza api app`
   (or `./handlers`) does the same for this app's own packages. An import
   of a framework package that does not exist fails `lidza check` (L004).
10. A pattern this app uses twice is a recipe: write it under "App
   recipes" (`lidza recipe add "Title"`) so the next task follows it.
11. Before writing a handler, page, test or tool of a kind you have not
   written here, read the matching snippet (`lidza snippet` or the MCP
   tool `lidza_snippet`): it is the reference app's code, verified by its
   tests.
12. The brief (`docs/brief.md`) and the working agreements and Team
   notes at the end of `AGENTS.md` are this
   app's shared memory: read them first, fill the brief with the
   developer while it has open questions (recipe "Start with the
   brief"), and record a lasting fact with `lidza note add` (MCP
   `lidza_note_add`), never in an agent's local memory. `lidza check`
   L015 warns while a required question is open.
13. A pack (Rust or official), a dependency, an integration or a schema
   tradeoff is a decision: read `docs/decisions.md` before changing those
   areas and record yours in the same commit (`lidza decision add
   "Title" --why "..."`, MCP `lidza_decision_add`; `lidza pack add --why`
   records it for a pack). `lidza check` L012 flags a pack or a direct
   dependency no decision names, and L011 a pack no code uses; CI runs
   `lidza verify --strict`, where warnings fail.

## Templates

What each frontend template ships; the API contract, `lidza check`,
`lidza test` and the packs are the same for all.

| | react | svelte | astro | htmx |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rendering | client routes, prerendered at build; per-request SSR with `LIDZA_SSR=1` | one page, prerendered at build, hydrated | static pages at build | Go templates per request |
| Data | `@lidza/client` with TanStack Query, live refetch via `useLive` | `@lidza/client` in components | `@lidza/client` in page scripts | Go handlers, htmx partials |
| Accessibility | `jsx-a11y`, errors | Svelte compiler a11y checks, errors | `jsx-a11y` through `eslint-plugin-astro`, errors | none automated |
| Browser tests | `e2e/` (Playwright), `lidza test --e2e` | same | same | `pages_test.go` in Go |
| Time zone cookie | `src/timezone.ts` | same | same | inline in `views/layout.html` |
| Translated pages | `src/i18n.ts`, a page per locale at build | same | none | Go handlers (`i18n.From(ctx).T`) |
| Analytics reporter | `VITE_ANALYTICS=1` | `VITE_ANALYTICS=1` | `PUBLIC_ANALYTICS=1` | `ANALYTICS_FRONTEND=1`, `static/analytics.js` |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 | `app.css` | `<style is:global>` in the layout | `static/app.css` |

This app uses the **react** template.

## Parallel work

Several agents or branches at once, each in its own git worktree
(`git worktree add ../app-feature feature`), run `lidza install` there
first. It copies what git does not carry from the main checkout (`.env`,
`config/master.key`), links `node_modules` when `package-lock.json` is the
same, and gives the worktree databases of its own (`<app>_feature_dev`,
`<app>_feature_test`) in `.env.local` and `.env.test.local`, the
checkout's own settings files that win over the committed ones, so one
worktree's migrations never land in another's database. `lidza test`
does the test database part by itself. `LIDZA_DB_SUFFIX` names any
checkout's databases apart.

Merging the branches back: migrations are named by time, so two never
share a name; `docs/decisions.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` keep both branches'
entries (git's union merge, in `.gitattributes`); `db/schema.lock.json`
merges model by model through the driver `lidza gen` registers in the
clone (`merge.lidza-lock`). Two branches that changed the same model
differently stop the merge on the lock: merge `schema.lidza`, then
`lidza gen`. After any merge, `lidza gen` (or `lidza dev`) regenerates
the rest.

## Tests

`routes_test.go` shows the shape: `srv := lidzatest.Start(t, app())`
boots the app with its packs (`.env.test`, `LIDZA_MODE=test`) and
`srv.JSON(t, method, path, body, &out, lidzatest.Bearer(token))` calls it.
Run `lidza test`.

Time and outbound HTTP are testable when handlers use `lidza.Now(ctx)`
instead of `time.Now()` and `lidza.HTTPClient(ctx)` instead of
`http.DefaultClient`: `srv.Clock.Set(t)` freezes time, and
`lidzatest.Start(t, app(), lidzatest.WithRecorder("name"))` replays
`testdata/http/name.json`, recorded once with `LIDZA_RECORD=1 lidza test`.

Layout in the browser suite: `e2e/layout.ts` has `expectNoSidewaysScroll(page)`
(nothing wider than the viewport, a bug at any width) and
`expectFitsViewport(page)` (the page does not scroll down, for an app
whose design says so); the home spec checks a phone's width, and `lidza
audit layout` checks every page at every viewport and theme.

Call a pack from the test as a handler would with `srv.Context()`:
`mail.From(srv.Context()).WaitFor(ctx, to, subject, 5*time.Second)` waits
for a message a job sends; `jobs.From(srv.Context()).Get` reads a job.
A test acting as several users passes each one's token with
`lidzatest.Bearer(token)`; the server's client keeps the cookies of the
last sign-in. `lidza test -v` (MCP: `lidza_test` with `verbose`) lists
every test as it runs.

Browser tests live in `e2e/*.spec.ts` (Playwright); `lidza test --e2e`
runs them against the built binary. If the browser is missing the command
prints the install line; `lidza test --e2e --install` runs it (`lidza
setup` installs it up front). Locate by role and accessible name, and
pass `exact: true` when one name is a prefix of another ("Comment" and
"Comments", a card and its "Move ... to Done" button).

## Recipes

Step-by-step tasks. Each one is also a prompt in `lidza mcp`, a skill in
`.claude/skills/<name>` (Claude Code) and `.agents/skills/<name>` (Codex
and Gemini CLI); `lidza gen` rewrites them from
the guide. This section is the framework's: `lidza gen` refreshes it when
the framework changes. This app's own recipes go under "App recipes"
below, which the framework never touches. Every recipe ends the same way: `lidza check
--json` (MCP: `lidza_check`) until `"status": "ok"`, then `lidza test`
(`lidza_test`).

### Start with the brief

Fill the app's brief with the developer before building: what it is
for, who owns the data, the design, the services, where it runs and how
you work together. The answers are the app's shared memory, in git.

1. `lidza_brief` (MCP) lists the open questions: each with why it is
   asked, its kind (`one`, `many`, `text`) and suggested answers.
   `lidza://brief` reads the file.
2. Ask the developer a few questions at a time with your question tool
   (in Claude Code, AskUserQuestion): the question, two to four
   suggestions (the tool's, adjusted to what you know of the app, the
   likeliest first) and room for their own answer; a `many` question
   takes several. Offer "later" and "skip" with every question, and
   "skip the rest" for the whole brief. Never answer for them. Later
   leaves the question open; skip (`lidza_brief_skip`, with the id, or
   no ids for every open question) closes it: it is not asked again.
3. Record each answer with `lidza_brief_answer`, in their words or the
   suggestion they picked. It lands in `docs/brief.md` and where it
   acts: a decision in `docs/decisions.md`, the working agreements in
   the agent files, the palette in the design tokens and
   `admin/theme.css`, a seeded app recipe ("Scope a query in this app",
   "Style a page to match the app", "Import or seed data"). Apply what
   the result lists under `manual` yourself.
4. The required questions first (purpose, users, journeys, ownership,
   sign-in, palette, pushing): `lidza check` warns while they are open
   (L015).
5. Summarize the answers and what was written, then commit `docs/`, the
   agent files, `src/index.css` and `admin/`.
6. Later, a fact the developer states goes in with `lidza_note_add`, and
   a changed answer with `lidza_brief_answer` again. In a terminal the
   same interview is `lidza brief`.

### Add an API route

Expose one operation under `/api/v1/` with typed input and output, so it
is validated on the server and callable from the client by name.

1. Declare the shapes in `schema.lidza`:

   ```
   type CreateThing {
     title string @min(1) @max(200)
   }
   type Thing {
     id    uuid
     title string
   }
   ```

2. Register the handler in `routes.go`:

   ```go
   router.Route(r, "POST /api/v1/things", createThing)

   func createThing(ctx context.Context, req *router.Request[schema.CreateThing]) (schema.Thing, error) {
   	req.Status(http.StatusCreated)
   	return schema.Thing{ID: "1", Title: req.Body.Title}, nil
   }
   ```

   `In` is `router.None` without a body, `Out` is `router.None` for 204.
   The body is decoded and validated (422 with field errors) before the
   handler runs. Return `router.NotFound("thing")` or
   `router.Errorf(status, ...)` for client-visible errors; any other error
   is a 500 whose text stays on the server. The handler name becomes the
   client method (`createThing` gives `api.createThing`). A list that
   takes filters reads them with `req.Query("q")`; the client sends them
   as `{ query: { q, limit } }`. A file upload takes `router.File` as
   `In` (recipe "Store a file").

   A reply that arrives in pieces (a model's text, progress) is a
   stream: `router.Stream(r, "POST /api/v1/things/draft", draftThing)`
   with `func draftThing(ctx context.Context, req
   *router.Request[schema.CreateThing], send func(string) error) error`.
   Each `send` reaches the client at once as a server-sent event; the
   event is a schema type, a string or a number. Return nil to end the
   stream. An error before the first `send` is an ordinary reply, after
   it the client gets it as an error with its status. `send` fails when
   the client has gone; return then. A stream's deadline is
   `App.StreamTimeout` (10 minutes by default; the generated clients ask
   with `Accept: text/event-stream`), not the 30 seconds of other
   requests.

   Routes that share middleware go on a group:
   `g := r.Group("/api/v1/things", auth.Require())`, then
   `router.Route(g, "GET /api/v1/things/recent", recentThings)` with
   the full pattern. The prefix may hold wildcards
   (`r.Group("/api/v1/things/{id}")`, read with `req.Param("id")`), and
   every pattern of the group lies under it (another panics). Groups
   do not hide routes: all patterns share one ServeMux, so the most
   specific wins wherever it was registered (`GET
   /api/v1/things/recent` in a group over `GET /api/v1/things/{slug}`
   on `r`), two that conflict panic at start, and the group's
   middleware runs for its own routes only (a path no route matches is
   a 404 before it).

3. Save. `lidza dev` regenerates `schema/`, rebuilds, and rewrites the
   client (without it: `lidza gen`, MCP `lidza_gen`). Check with
   `curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/things -d '{"title":"x"}'`.

4. Call it from the frontend as `api.createThing({ title })` from
   `@lidza/client`; never `fetch` by hand (`lidza check` warns, L003).
   A stream's method returns an async iterable: `for await (const piece
   of api.draftThing({ title }, { signal })) text += piece`; leaving the
   loop or aborting the signal closes the request. The Dart client
   returns a `Stream`.

5. Add a test in `routes_test.go` (see "Write a test") and run
   `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Add a resource

Give a model the five standard routes (list, get, create, patch, delete)
backed by Postgres. Needs the `db` and `auth` packs (`lidza pack add db`,
`lidza pack add auth`).

1. Declare a `model` in `schema.lidza`. A post belongs to its author:

   ```
   model Post {
     id        uuid     @id @default(uuid())
     ownerId   uuid     @index
     title     string   @min(1) @max(200)
     body      string?
     createdAt time     @default(now())
   }
   ```

   The model is owned when it has an owner field, the first of: a field
   `ownerId`, a field with `@ref(User)` or `@ref(AuthUser)` (such as
   `userId uuid @ref(User)`; a `userId` without the reference is not
   the owner). The owner is `uuid` or `string` and required: it holds
   the signed-in user's id. A model whose rows every signed-in user
   shares (a team's projects, a membership table) is marked `@shared`
   (`model Project @shared {`): behind sign-in, not scoped. One whose
   rows belong to no one and that visitors may change (rare) is marked
   `@public` (`model Tag @public {`).
2. Run `lidza gen resource Post` (MCP: `lidza_gen_resource` with
   `model: "Post"`): it writes `db/queries/post.sql`, the
   `CreatePost`, `UpdatePost` and `PostList` types in `schema.lidza`,
   `handlers/post.go` with the routes under `/api/v1/posts`, and in
   `routes.go` a group behind `auth.Require()` with the routes on it:

   ```go
   posts := r.Group("/api/v1/posts", auth.Require())
   handlers.PostRoutes(posts)
   ```

   For an owned model every statement filters by `owner_id` (list,
   count, get, update, delete), create sets it from
   `auth.CurrentUser(ctx).ID`, the `Create` and `Update` types leave it
   out, and another user's row is a 404. `--public` (MCP: `public: true`)
   marks the model `@public`: no owner, routes open to visitors.
   `--shared` (MCP: `shared: true`) marks it `@shared`: behind sign-in,
   rows not scoped to one user.
3. Run `lidza db migrate` (MCP: `lidza_db_migrate`) to apply the new
   migration in `db/migrations/`.
4. The generated files are ordinary code: add filters or routes there.
   `lidza check` flags a query on an owned table that neither filters by
   nor sets the owner (L018); a query meant to cross users (an admin
   page) takes `-- lidza:ignore L018` on the line before its
   `-- name:`. Regenerate with `--force` to reset the handlers (files
   generated before owners were scoped keep their old code until then).
5. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`: a second user lists nothing and
   gets 404 on the first user's id.

### Add sign-in

Give the app accounts through the auth pack's own sign-in: email and
password by default, sign-in providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, any
OIDC issuer) when configured. The app writes no login handler and no
OAuth flow.

1. `lidza pack add auth` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`; needs `db`, and `mail`
   for the verification and reset links). In `routes.go`:
   `auth.Mount(r, auth.Options{Title: "thura"})`. `lidza gen` then
   writes the client: `api.authRegister`, `authLogin`, `authLogout`,
   `authSession`, `authMe`, `authVerify`, `authForgot`, `authReset`,
   `authPassword`, `authDelete`, `authProviders`. Accounts live in
   `auth_user`; the app's rows carry the user's id,
   `auth.CurrentUser(ctx).ID` (recipe "Scope a query to the signed-in
   user").
2. Pages: the sign-in page calls `api.authLogin({ email, password })`
   and shows a 401 as "wrong email or password" and `err.fields` from a
   422; registration calls `api.authRegister`; the app shell reads
   `api.authSession()` once (`user` is null for a visitor). A "remember
   me" box sends `remember` to `authLogin` or `authRegister`: `false`
   makes the auth cookies session cookies (no expiry, on this reply and
   every renewal), so the session ends when the browser closes; absent
   or `true` keeps them for `AUTH_REFRESH_TTL`. Render one
   button per entry of `api.authProviders()` as a plain link to its
   `url` (add `?redirect=/path` to land elsewhere than `/`, and
   `remember=false` for a session that ends with the browser); the callback
   sets the cookies and redirects, or lands on `/login?error=...`. The
   pages `/verify` and `/reset` read `?token=` and call `authVerify` or
   `authReset`. While `me.verified` is false, a banner offers
   `authVerifyResend()`: a new link to the signed-in user's address
   (nothing is sent once it is verified, or with `NoVerifyEmail`).
3. Providers: `AUTH_PROVIDERS=google,github` in `.env` or on the admin
   pages (section "Sign-in providers"); the client id and secret in the
   credentials: `lidza credentials set AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...`. Register the callback
   `<APP_URL>/api/v1/auth/google/callback` with the provider. Microsoft
   takes `AUTH_MICROSOFT_TENANT`; another OIDC issuer takes
   `AUTH_<NAME>_ISSUER` (and `AUTH_<NAME>_LABEL`). An identity whose
   email the provider vouches for joins the local account of that
   address; the admin Users page shows how each account signs in.
   Options: `NoRegister` (invite-only; `auth.From(ctx).CreateUser` adds
   accounts), `NoLocal` (providers only), `RequireVerified`,
   `NoVerifyEmail` (registration sends no verification link), `Claims`
   (roles into the token), `AfterSignIn`. The login route has a
   throttle of its own: `AUTH_SIGNIN_RPS` and `AUTH_SIGNIN_BURST`,
   else `AUTH_LOGIN_RPS` and `AUTH_LOGIN_BURST` as for register, verify,
   forgot and reset.
4. New accounts: `OnSignUp` runs once per account the routes create (a
   registration, or a provider's first sign-in that makes a new
   account; not a later sign-in, not an identity joining an existing
   account, not `CreateUser`), inside the transaction that inserts it.
   Write the app's rows there, with the transaction:

   ```go
   auth.Mount(r, auth.Options{
   	OnSignUp: func(ctx context.Context, tx pgx.Tx, s auth.SignUp) error {
   		// s.Method is "password" or the provider ("google"); s.Lang the request's language.
   		return queries.New(tx).CreateProfile(ctx, queries.CreateProfileParams{UserID: s.Profile.Subject, Lang: s.Lang})
   	},
   	OnDeleteUser: func(ctx context.Context, tx pgx.Tx, subject string) error {
   		return queries.New(tx).DeleteProfile(ctx, subject)
   	},
   })
   ```

   An error from `OnSignUp` rolls the account back: registration replies
   with it (`router.Errorf(403, ...)` as is), a provider sign-in lands on
   `/login?error=signup`. Do not detect sign-ups in `Claims`.
   Every sign-in (a password, a provider, and the one after a sign-up)
   runs `OnSignIn(ctx, auth.SignIn{Profile, Method, Request, Remember})`
   before the session opens: claim invitations sent to the user's email
   there, or finish a join they started signed out. `s.Request` is the
   login, register or provider callback request (its address, the app's
   own cookies); `s.SetCookie` adds a cookie to the reply, sent only when
   the sign-in succeeds:

   ```go
   OnSignIn: func(ctx context.Context, s auth.SignIn) error {
   	c, err := s.Request.Cookie("pending_join")
   	if err != nil {
   		return nil
   	}
   	n, err := queries.New(db.From(ctx)).JoinTeam(ctx, queries.JoinTeamParams{Code: c.Value, UserID: s.Profile.Subject})
   	if err != nil {
   		return err
   	}
   	s.SetCookie(&http.Cookie{Name: "pending_join", Path: "/", MaxAge: -1})
   	s.SetCookie(&http.Cookie{Name: "notice", Value: fmt.Sprintf("joined-%d", n), Path: "/", MaxAge: 60})
   	return nil
   },
   ```

   An error refuses the sign-in (`?error=signin` for a provider). Token
   refreshes do not run it, and neither does `Claims`, which runs for
   every token and is for claims only.
5. Deleting an account: set `OnDeleteUser` (it deletes or anonymizes
   the app's rows of the subject; a no-op when the app keeps none), which
   also serves the route. The account page links to a form that calls
   `api.authDelete({ password })`; an account without a password (a
   provider only) sends `{}` and must have signed in within ten minutes,
   else a 403 with code `reauthenticate` (send the user through the
   provider's `url` with `?redirect=` back to the form); a wrong password
   is a 403 with code `wrong_password`. Switch on `err.code` of the
   `ApiError`, not the message. The
   route removes the user, identities, sessions and tokens, runs
   `OnDeleteUser` in the same transaction for the app's rows (an error
   rolls it all back), and clears the cookies. From the app or an admin
   action: `auth.From(ctx).DeleteUser(ctx, id)`; an app with its own
   users table uses `DeleteUserTx(ctx, tx, id)` in its transaction.

   A security log: `OnEvent(ctx, auth.Event{Kind, Subject, Email,
   Method, Reason, Request})` runs after each account event the routes
   handle: `auth.EventSignedIn`, `EventSignInFailed` (Reason
   `bad_credentials`, `not_verified`, `refused`, `disabled`, or a
   provider's `denied`, `state`, `provider`, `signup`; Subject empty for
   an address no account has), `EventSignedOut`, `EventSignedUp`,
   `EventPasswordChanged`, `EventPasswordCheckFailed` (a wrong current
   password on the change or delete route), `EventResetRequested`,
   `EventPasswordReset`, `EventEmailVerified` and `EventAccountDeleted`.
   It cannot refuse anything and runs on the request: insert a row (the
   subject, the kind, `Request.RemoteAddr` or the app's client address,
   the user agent) and log your own errors.
6. Emails: with the mail pack the links go out as plain text, or
   through `mail/auth_verify.txt.tmpl` and `mail/auth_reset.txt.tmpl`
   when the app has them (Data: `App`, `Link`, `Email`, `Name`). A
   language's copy is `mail/auth_verify.<lang>.txt.tmpl` (`de`, `pt-BR`),
   chosen by the request's language (recipe "Send an email"); it names
   its subject with `{{define "subject"}}...{{end}}`.
   `NoVerifyEmail: true` sends no verification link at registration: an
   app that sends its own welcome email does so from `OnSignUp` (with
   `RequireVerified`, it must then send a link itself:
   `IssueToken(ctx, auth.PurposeVerifyEmail, s.Profile.Subject, 0)` and
   `VerifyPath?token=`, which the verify route redeems).
7. Test: `lidzatest.Start`, `POST /api/v1/auth/register`, then a scoped
   route with the cookies the reply set. The providers are tested by the
   framework (against an OIDC issuer in a test server), not by the app.
   `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Scope a query to the signed-in user

Make a resource answer only with the rows its user may see: a row
another user may not read is a 404, never a 403 (the reply must not
confirm it exists).

1. Behind `auth.Require()`, take the user from the context:
   `user := auth.CurrentUser(ctx).ID`, never from the body.
2. Owned rows (one user each): give the model an owner field (`ownerId
   uuid`) and `lidza gen resource` writes the scoped queries and
   handlers (recipe "Add a resource"). By hand: `AND owner_id = $N` in
   every statement of `db/queries/<table>.sql` (list, count, get,
   update, delete), `owner_id` set from the user on create, and no
   `ownerId` in the `Create` and `Update` types. `lidza check` flags a
   query that misses it (L018). The snippets `queries` and
   `resource-handlers` are this case.
3. Shared rows (a team, a project): keep a membership table
   (`Membership @shared { projectId @ref(Project, cascade), userId
   @ref(User, cascade), role }` with `@@unique(projectId, userId)`;
   `@shared` because its rows belong to the project, not to the user
   the `userId` names) and join on it:

   ```sql
   -- name: GetTask :one
   SELECT t.* FROM task t JOIN membership m ON m.project_id = t.project_id
   WHERE t.id = sqlc.arg('id') AND m.user_id = sqlc.arg('user_id');
   ```

   Lists and creates that take the parent id from the path check it
   first with one helper (`requireMember(ctx, projectID)` in
   `handlers/access.go`: a membership lookup, 404 when absent, 403 for a
   role that may read but not do this). Qualify columns (`t.id`) in an
   `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT ...)`, or sqlc reports them ambiguous.
4. Reply `router.NotFound("task")` on `pgx.ErrNoRows` and on zero rows
   affected.
5. Test it: a second user lists nothing and gets 404 on the first user's
   id; a member of the project sees the row. `lidza check`, then
   `lidza test`.

### Add a page

Add a client-side route rendered by React, prerendered at build time.

1. Create `src/pages/Things.tsx` exporting a component.
2. In `src/router.tsx`, declare `createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: '/things', component: Things })` and add it to the route tree.
3. Fetch data with `useQuery({ queryKey: ['things'], queryFn: () => api.listThings() })`
   from `@lidza/client`; never `fetch` by hand.
4. Routes without parameters are prerendered by `npm run build`; keep
   the first render free of browser-only APIs (`window`, `localStorage`),
   read them in effects. A route with a `loader` that calls `api.*` is
   not prerendered (no API at build time; the build says so) and renders
   in the browser, unless the binary runs with `LIDZA_SSR=1`: then every
   page renders per request in a Node sidecar, the loader runs on the
   server with the visitor's cookies forwarded, and the page arrives with
   its data and the router's hydration payload, so the loader does not
   run again in the browser.
5. Live data: `useLive(['things'])` (src/live.ts) refetches the `things`
   queries when a handler publishes to that topic on the `realtime` pack.
6. Forms: `validators.CreateThing(values)` from `@lidza/client` returns the
   field errors the server would, before the request.
7. Every element must be accessible: `lidza check` fails on `jsx-a11y`
   errors (missing `alt`, click handlers on non-interactive elements, ...).
8. Style with Tailwind utilities; colors and fonts come from the `@theme`
   tokens in `src/index.css` (`bg-brand`, `text-ink`, `border-line`,
   `text-muted`, `text-danger`). Change the tokens, not the classes, to
   rebrand. No other CSS framework.
9. Text in more than one language (the `i18n` pack, one
   `locales/<lang>.json` per language): write every string as
   `t('things.title')` from `src/i18n.ts`, never a literal, and add the
   key to every catalog (`t('things.count', n)` fills a `%d` or `%s`).
   `npm run build` renders each page once per locale and the binary
   serves the visitor's, with `<html lang>` and its catalog, so the first
   paint and hydration are in that language. Format numbers and dates
   with `Intl` and `locale()`; a language switch calls `setLocale('sq')`.
10. A public page that needs no React in the browser (text, links,
   images, a form that posts or a `mailto:`) sets `staticData: { static:
   true }` on its route: `npm run build` writes its HTML without the
   client runtime (no React, router or query code, no hydration), so a
   visitor landing on it downloads its HTML and CSS only (`lidza audit
   performance` shows the difference). It shows what it renders at build
   time: no `useQuery`, no loader that needs the API, no state. Its
   links are plain links. A little behaviour (a menu toggle, a form's
   checks) goes in `src/enhance/<name>.ts`, plain DOM code the page works
   without, named on the route: `staticData: { static: true, enhance:
   ['disclosure'] }` (`src/enhance/disclosure.ts` is the example). The
   app's pages keep hydrating as before; choose static per page. A site
   that is all content is the astro template's job.
11. Add a browser test in `e2e/things.spec.ts` (see "Write a test"), then
   `lidza check` and `lidza test --e2e`.

### Set the head of a page

Give each address its own title, description, canonical address, social
cards and structured data. Search engines and link previews read the
HTML the server sends, not what the browser renders later, and a route
with a parameter (`/products/$id`) is one shell for every address until
the server names it. The binary sets the head per request, without the
SSR sidecar.

1. In `main.go`, set `Head: head` on `lidza.App`, and write `head` in
   `head.go` (package main): `func head(r *http.Request) (lidza.Head,
   bool)`. It returns false for the pages it does not know; they keep the
   head they were built with.
2. Match the path (`id, ok := strings.CutPrefix(r.URL.Path,
   "/products/")`), load the record with one query
   (`queries.New(db.From(r.Context()))`: the packs are in the request's
   context), and fill `Title`, `Description`, `Canonical` (the absolute
   address), `Image` (absolute), `Type` (`article`, `product`; `website`
   when empty), `SiteName`, further tags in `Meta`
   (`lidza.HeadMeta{Property: "article:published_time", Content: ...}`)
   and `JSONLD` (maps or structs, each written as its own `<script
   type="application/ld+json">`).
3. A missing record: `lidza.Head{Title: "Not found", NoIndex: true,
   Status: http.StatusNotFound}`, so the address answers 404 and is not
   indexed. A draft or private page: `NoIndex: true`.
4. Pass plain text: every value is escaped where it is written, JSON-LD
   included. The title, the description, the canonical link and each tag
   replace the page's own of the same name; the rest of the page's head
   (stylesheets, scripts) stays. og:title, og:description, og:url,
   og:image and the twitter tags follow from the fields.
5. It applies to the shell, the prerendered pages, the pages the SSR
   sidecar renders and, under `lidza dev`, the dev server's. Setting
   `document.title` in the browser on navigation stays the client's job;
   the server's head is for the first load and for crawlers.
6. Test it in `routes_test.go`: call `head` with
   `httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/products/"+id,
   nil).WithContext(srv.Context())` (`srv` from `lidzatest.Start`) and
   check `Title`, `Canonical` and the 404 `Status`. `lidza check`, then
   `lidza test`.

### Add a responsive image

Ship each image at the size the screen needs, in AVIF or WebP, without
layout shift.

1. Put the image under `src/` (not `public/`, which is copied as it is)
   and import it with `?responsive`: `import hero from
   './hero.jpg?responsive'`. The build (`vite-imagetools`, configured in
   `vite.config.ts`) writes it at 480, 800, 1200, 1600 and 2400 pixels
   wide (those below its own width, then its own) in AVIF, WebP and the
   original format, content-hashed in `dist/assets/`, which the binary
   caches for a year. No encoder to install: `npm install` brings one.
2. Render it with `<Picture image={hero} alt="..."
   sizes="(min-width: 768px) 50vw, 100vw" />` from `src/picture.tsx`. `sizes`
   says how wide the image is drawn, so the browser downloads one
   variant that fits; the default, `100vw`, is right only for a
   full-width image. The width and height it carries keep the page from
   shifting while it loads.
3. The largest image of the first screen (the LCP element) gets
   `priority`: loaded eagerly and first. Every other image loads lazily.
   Never preload the variants by hand.
4. An app made before `vite-imagetools` was in the template: `npm i -D
   vite-imagetools`, then copy `vite.config.ts`'s `responsive` lines,
   the `?responsive` declaration in `src/vite-env.d.ts` and `src/picture.tsx` from
   a new app (`lidza new tmp --template react`).
5. Images people upload are the media pack's (resized and converted on
   upload, "Store a file"); this recipe is for the images the app ships.
6. `alt` describes the image for someone who cannot see it; an image
   that only decorates gets `alt=""`.

### Add a pack capability

Run work in Rust, compiled to WASM and called from a handler with a
deadline: for code that must be contained, a crate Go lacks, or heap
pressure. Read "Rust: when and how" first; it is not for speed.

1. Record why this module is Rust (`lidza decision add "<module> in a
   Rust pack" --why "contained input | crate X | heap pressure"`, MCP
   `lidza_decision_add`), then `lidza pack scaffold <name>`: it creates
   `packs/<name>` with a crate and an example capability (skip when the
   pack exists).
2. Declare the input and output types in `schema.lidza`.
3. In `packs/<name>/rust/src/lib.rs` write
   `lidza_export!(capability, |input: In| -> Result<Out, String>)`; the
   Rust structs come from `packs/<name>/rust/src/schema.rs`, generated.
4. List the capability in `packs/<name>/pack.lidza.json` with its input
   and output type names.
5. `lidza check` builds the module and writes `packs/<name>/pack.go`.
   From a handler: `out, err := <name>.From(ctx).<Capability>(ctx, in)`.
   The MCP tool `pack_<name>_<capability>` runs it directly.

### Add an MCP tool

Let an agent call a function of this app, with its packs, from
`lidza mcp` (as `app_<name>`) and from the running binary at `/mcp`.

1. In `tools.go` add to the list returned by `tools()`:

   ```go
   lidza.ToolFunc("count_posts", "Number of posts.", func(ctx context.Context, _ struct{}) (int, error) {
   	var n int
   	err := db.From(ctx).QueryRow(ctx, "SELECT count(*) FROM post").Scan(&n)
   	return n, err
   }),
   ```

2. Say what it does to the data: `ReadOnly: true` for a lookup or a
   report, so the agent's client runs it without asking, and
   `Destructive: true` for one that deletes or overwrites. A tool marked
   neither counts as one that may destroy, and the client asks first:

   ```go
   count := lidza.ToolFunc("count_posts", "Number of posts.", countPosts)
   count.ReadOnly = true
   ```

3. Give the input a `schema.lidza` type to have its rules enforced; the
   input schema shown to the agent comes from the Go type.
4. `lidza check`; then restart `lidza mcp` (the MCP client reconnects) and
   call `app_count_posts`.

### Send an email

Send a transactional email (verification, reset, receipt) through the
mail pack, never through a vendor SDK.

1. `lidza pack add mail` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`; after `db`, and `jobs`
   for background delivery);
   set `MAIL_FROM` and, in production, `MAIL_PROVIDER` with its key in
   `.env`. `.env.test` gets `MAIL_PROVIDER=outbox`.
2. Write the bodies as Go templates: `mail/<name>.txt.tmpl` (always) and
   `mail/<name>.html.tmpl` (optional), over the `Data` you pass. Other
   languages: `mail/<name>.<lang>.txt.tmpl` (`verify.de.txt.tmpl`,
   `verify.pt-BR.txt.tmpl`). Send picks `<name>.<lang>`, then the base
   language (`pt` for `pt-BR`), then `<name>`, for the message's `Lang`,
   else the request's language: the `i18n` pack's locale when it runs,
   else `Accept-Language`. Outside a request (a job), set `Lang` from
   the user's stored language. A template that defines
   `{{define "subject"}}...{{end}}` in its
   `.txt.tmpl` sets the subject, so it is translated with the body.
3. From a handler or a job:

   ```go
   _, err := mail.From(ctx).Send(ctx, mail.Message{
   	To: user.Email, Subject: "Verify your email", Template: "verify",
   	Data: map[string]string{"Link": mail.From(ctx).Link("/verify?token=" + token)},
   })
   ```

   `Link` makes the path absolute with `APP_URL` (`.env`: the address
   the app is reached at from an inbox), so the link works outside the
   outbox. Send returns once the row is in the outbox (queued for the
   jobs pack, or delivered right away without it). The outbox preserves
   `From`, `ReplyTo`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Attachments` and custom `Headers` for delivery and retries. Do not build the
   message with `fmt.Sprintf` and do not call the vendor's API.

   When mail follows a database write, use `SendTx(ctx, tx, message)`
   inside that write's transaction. It requires both `db` and `jobs`,
   using the same database as `tx`; it stores the outbox row and delivery
   job together. The caller commits or rolls back, and must roll back on
   any error. Do not call ordinary `Send` inside a transaction: it uses
   its own connection and transaction. Workers cannot see a queued
   message until commit. Delivery retains the jobs pack's retries;
   this does not guarantee exactly-once delivery at the provider.

   ```go
   _, err := mail.From(ctx).SendTx(ctx, tx, mail.Message{
       To: user.Email, Subject: "Your receipt", Template: "receipt", Data: receipt,
   })
   if err != nil {
       return err // the caller rolls back tx, including its earlier writes
   }
   return tx.Commit(ctx)
   ```

   `To` also accepts a comma-separated address list. `Cc` and `Bcc` are
   slices of individual addresses; display names are allowed. Each address
   must appear only once across the three lists. Blind recipients are
   never included in SMTP headers. Attach files as `mail.Attachment{Name:
   "receipt.pdf", ContentType: "application/pdf", Data: pdfBytes}`; pass
   bytes, never a path or URL. An empty content type is detected from the
   bytes. Attachments and recipients survive queued delivery and retries.
   For embedded HTML files, set `ContentID: "logo@message"` on the attachment
   and reference it as `cid:logo@message` in HTML. IDs are unique, at most
   127 bytes of printable ASCII, without whitespace, angle brackets,
   parentheses, square brackets, backslashes, commas, colons, semicolons or
   double quotes. Pass the bare ID, without `cid:`. Inline and ordinary files
   share the attachment limits; inline files require an HTML body.
   `ReplyTo` accepts a comma-separated address list, bounded independently by
   `MAIL_MAX_RECIPIENTS`, with no duplicate addresses. Custom header names
   are unique ignoring case; the pack refuses ambiguous duplicates.
   Defaults: `MAIL_MAX_RECIPIENTS=50`, `MAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENTS=10`,
   `MAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES=10485760` (total decoded bytes), and
   `MAIL_SMTP_TIMEOUT=30s` for the entire SMTP exchange.
   Custom `Headers` cannot override address, subject or MIME headers;
   use the message fields. Header values must not contain control characters.
4. Test it: `mail.From(srv.Context()).WaitFor(ctx, to, "Verify", 5*time.Second)`
   returns the newest message to that address whose subject contains the
   text, waiting for one a job sends; `Outbox(ctx, 5)` lists them newest
   first. Both have `Status`, `Text` and `HTML`; read the link out of the
   text. The snippet `auth-handlers` and `routes_test.go` in the
   reference app show both sides. For `SendTx`, also assert that rolling
   back leaves neither the app write, the outbox row nor the delivery job.
5. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`. In dev, `lidza_mail` (MCP) shows the
   outbox.

### Add a background job

Do work outside the request (send a notification, resize an upload, call
a slow API) through the jobs pack: the request enqueues, a worker runs
the handler later with retries, on this node or another. Recurring work
(every 15 minutes, Mondays at 09:00) is a schedule the pack enqueues.

1. `lidza pack add jobs` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`; after `db`).
2. Declare the payload in `schema.lidza` (`type NotifyTask { taskId uuid
   actorId uuid }`) so both sides share it.
3. Write the handler, `func NotifyTask(ctx context.Context, payload
   json.RawMessage) error` in `handlers/notify.go`: decode the payload,
   read the current state by id (the job runs after the request, so the
   row may have changed or gone), do the work. The context carries the
   packs: `db.From(ctx)`, `mail.From(ctx)`, `realtime.From(ctx)` work as
   in a request handler. Return an error to retry (backoff, up to
   `JOBS_MAX_ATTEMPTS`). A job can run more than once: after a retry, or
   after a shutdown, which gives a running job `JOBS_DRAIN` (1s) to
   finish, then cancels its context and puts it back to pending for the
   next node or the restart. Stop when `ctx` is done and make a rerun
   harmless (upserts, a done marker per item).
4. Register it in `start.go`:

   ```go
   jobs.FromServices(s).Handle("notify.task", handlers.NotifyTask)
   ```

   A kind that must not overlap with itself (a sync against one outside
   account, a rebuild of one index) takes a cap that holds across every
   node: `Handle("catalog.sync", handlers.CatalogSync,
   jobs.Concurrency(1))`. Jobs over the cap wait as pending while the
   workers run other kinds; no advisory lock in the handler. Every node
   that handles the kind declares the same cap.
5. Enqueue from the handler that caused it: `jobs.From(ctx).Enqueue(ctx,
   "notify.task", schema.NotifyTask{...})`, or inside a transaction
   `EnqueueTx(ctx, tx, ...)` so the job is committed with the write and
   never runs for one that rolled back. `jobs.RunAt(t)` delays one run.
   Never do the work in the request as a fallback. When many requests
   can ask for the same work (every view of a post that lacks its
   thumbnails), give it a key: `Enqueue(ctx, "post.thumbnails", p,
   jobs.Unique("post:"+id))` stores one job while one with that kind and
   key is pending or running, on any node, and returns that job's id;
   `jobs.Existed(&found)` says whether it was already there. Once the
   job is done or failed, the key queues new work again.
6. Work on a timetable (a weekly digest, a sync every 15 minutes) is a
   schedule in `start.go`, not a job that enqueues its next run:

   ```go
   q := jobs.FromServices(s)
   q.Handle("digest.weekly", handlers.WeeklyDigest)
   if err := q.Schedule("digest.weekly", jobs.Weekly(time.Monday, "09:00", "Europe/Tirane"), nil); err != nil {
   	return err
   }
   ```

   `jobs.Every(15*time.Minute)` runs at :00, :15, :30 and :45;
   `jobs.Daily("06:30", zone)` and `jobs.Weekly(day, "09:00", zone)`
   run at a clock time in a time zone ("" is UTC), once on the days the
   clocks change; `jobs.DailyAt(zone, "02:00", "10:00", "18:00")` runs
   at several clock times a day. The payload (here `nil`) goes with every run. However
   many nodes run, one job is enqueued per due time; after downtime one
   missed run is enqueued, not one per missed time. The `job_schedule`
   table, like the job table's `uniqueKey` column, comes from
   `schema.lidza`: `lidza gen`, then `lidza db migrate`. The admin Jobs page lists each schedule with its next and
   last run.
7. Test it: the job runs a moment after the reply. For mail,
   `mail.From(srv.Context()).WaitFor(...)`; otherwise poll
   `jobs.From(srv.Context()).Get(ctx, id)` until `State` is `done`. A
   scheduled job's handler is tested by enqueuing its kind directly.
8. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Publish live updates

Let every open page of a resource see a change without reloading,
through the realtime pack: handlers publish on a topic after a write,
the page subscribes and refetches.

1. `lidza pack add realtime` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`). More than one
   node needs `REALTIME_BUS_URL` (Valkey) so a publish on one reaches
   the sockets on the others.
2. Name topics by resource, `project:<id>`, in one function both sides
   use.
3. Mount the socket behind auth and authorize each topic; without
   `Authorize` no topic can be subscribed (`realtime.AllowAll` opens
   every topic to every connection, for topics that carry nothing
   private):

   ```go
   live := realtime.Handler(realtime.Authorize(func(r *http.Request, topic string) bool {
   	id, ok := strings.CutPrefix(topic, "project:")
   	return ok && isMember(r.Context(), id, auth.CurrentUser(r.Context()).ID)
   }))
   r.Group("/api/v1/realtime", auth.Require()).Handle("GET /api/v1/realtime", live)
   ```

4. Publish after the write is committed, ids and an event name only:
   `realtime.From(ctx).Publish(ctx, topic, schema.Change{Kind: "task.moved",
   ID: task.ID})`. The page refetches through the API, which enforces
   access; the row itself never travels over the socket.
5. In the page, key the queries by the topic and call `useLive([topic])`
   (`src/live.ts`): every message invalidates the queries whose key
   starts with it.
6. Test it in Go: `websocket.Dial` (`github.com/coder/websocket`, already
   a dependency) with `lidzatest.Bearer`'s header on
   `ws://.../api/v1/realtime?topics=...`, make the change through the
   API, read one message. A signed-out dial must be refused.
7. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Add an LLM feature

Put a language model behind an API route: a chat reply, a summary, a
structured extraction into a schema type, or a model that uses the
app's tools. The llm pack speaks the providers; the app never does.

1. `lidza pack add llm` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`). `.env` gets
   `LLM_PROVIDER=fake`; set `ollama` for a local model, or `anthropic`,
   `openai` or `google` with `LLM_API_KEY` and, when the default does not
   suit, `LLM_MODEL`. `.env.test` keeps `fake`. Try the setup with the
   MCP tool `lidza_llm` before writing code. Embeddings come from the
   chat provider unless `EMBED_PROVIDER` names another: `openai`,
   `google`, `ollama` or `compatible`, with `EMBED_API_KEY`,
   `EMBED_MODEL` and `EMBED_BASE_URL` as needed. Anthropic has no
   embedding model, so an Anthropic app that embeds sets it;
   `EMBED_PROVIDER=none` turns embeddings off. Keys go in the
   credentials (`lidza credentials set EMBED_API_KEY=...`).
2. Declare the output in `schema.lidza` when the reply is data, not
   prose:

   ```
   type NoteTags {
     tags string[] @min(1) @max(5)
   }
   ```

3. In the handler, read the rows the user may see (the route runs behind
   `auth.Require()` and the usual scoping), then call the model:

   ```go
   out, err := llm.Generate[schema.NoteTags](ctx, llm.From(ctx), llm.Request{
   	System:   "Tag notes with one to five short lowercase topics.",
   	Messages: []llm.Message{ {Role: llm.User, Content: note.Title + "\n\n" + note.Body} },
   	Label:    "note.tags",
   })
   ```

   `Label` names the feature: with the db pack every call is a row in
   `llm_usage` under it, so the usage report and the admin's Language
   model page show tokens per feature.

   `Chat` returns prose, `Stream` delivers it as it arrives (pass each
   piece to the `send` of a `router.Stream` route, see "Add an API
   route", or publish it on the realtime pack), and
   `Run(ctx, req, tools())` lets the model call the app's tools with the
   packs in its context. Keep the prompt in the handler or a `prompts/`
   file, never in the frontend, and never send a row the user may not
   read.

   Embeddings for search or similar items:

   ```go
   res, err := llm.From(ctx).Embeddings(ctx, llm.EmbedRequest{
   	Texts: []string{post.Title + "\n\n" + post.Body},
   	Label: "post.index",
   })
   ```

   `res.Vectors` has one vector per text, `res.Usage.Input` the tokens
   (Gemini reports none); the call is a row in `llm_usage` under its
   label, as a chat is. `Embed(ctx, texts)` is the same call without a
   label. When nothing can embed (`EMBED_PROVIDER=none`, or Anthropic
   without `EMBED_PROVIDER`) the error wraps `llm.ErrNoEmbeddings`;
   test it with `errors.Is` to fall back to keyword search.
4. Long calls (a summary of many rows, a batch) go through the jobs
   pack; the request enqueues and the page reads the result later.
5. Test with the fake: `.env.test` has `LLM_PROVIDER=fake`, so
   `llm.From(srv.Context()).Fake().ReplyJSON(schema.NoteTags{Tags:
   []string{"go"}})` scripts the next reply and `Fake().Calls()` shows
   the prompt the handler sent. Assert on both. The snippet
   `llm-handler` and `routes_test.go` in the reference app show it. The
   fake embeds too, the same vector for the same text. `.env.test` has
   `LLM_PROVIDER=fake` and `EMBED_PROVIDER=fake` (setup writes them,
   `lidza update` adds them), so a provider set in `.env` never reaches
   the tests.
6. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Store a file

Keep uploads and generated files in object storage through the storage
pack, with the app deciding who may read them.

1. `lidza pack add storage` (MCP: `lidza_pack_add`). Development and
   tests use `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` (files under `storage/`);
   production sets `s3` with `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` and
   the keys in the credentials (`lidza credentials set
   STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=... STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=...`).
2. Accept the upload with a typed route whose input is `router.File`
   (the body is the file itself, not JSON):

   ```go
   router.Route(g, "PUT /api/v1/posts/{id}/image", uploadImage, router.UploadLimit(10<<20))

   func uploadImage(ctx context.Context, req *router.Request[router.File]) (router.None, error) {
   	// the same access check as the post first
   	_, err := storage.From(ctx).Put(ctx, "posts/"+req.Param("id")+"/image", req.Body.Body,
   		storage.PutOptions{ContentType: req.Body.ContentType})
   	return router.None{}, err
   }
   ```

   `req.Body.Body` reads the bytes, bounded by `router.UploadLimit`
   (32 MB, `router.MaxUploadBytes`, without it): a larger body replies
   413. `req.Body.ContentType` and `req.Body.Name` are what the client
   sent; the name is never a key or a path. Store under a key that
   names the owner and the row (`posts/<id>/image`) and keep it in a
   column of the row when it does not follow from the id. The
   generated client takes the File or Blob after the path parameters:
   `await api.uploadImage({ id }, file, { onProgress: (sent, total) =>
   setShare(sent / total) })` (the File's type becomes the
   Content-Type, `contentType` overrides it; `onProgress` is optional
   and browser-only); the Dart client takes the bytes, `contentType`
   and `filename`. No hand-written `fetch`.
3. Read it back through the app (`storage.Handler` or a handler that
   checks access and streams `Get`), or hand the browser a
   `PresignGet` URL for a minute; never a permanent public URL for a
   private file. Delete the object when the row goes.
4. Test with the local provider: `.env.test` sets `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`
   and a `STORAGE_DIR`; upload through the API, read it back, delete the
   row and check `Stat` returns `storage.ErrNotFound`. The snippet
   `storage-handler` and `routes_test.go` in the reference app show it.
5. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Receive a webhook

Take a provider's deliveries (a payment provider's events, a mail
provider's bounces) on a route that verifies the signature on the raw
body, refuses replays and handles each delivery once, with
`pkg/webhook`. Never decode the body or trust a field before it is
verified.

1. Seal the signing secret for each mode: `lidza credentials set
   dev.PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... production.PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
   (the sandbox endpoint's secret for `lidza dev`, the live one for
   production). Without the setting every delivery is refused with 503
   and the log names it; an endpoint never runs unverified. A value
   saved from the admin pages applies within a minute.
2. Register the endpoint in `routes.go`, on `r` and not in a group
   behind `auth.Require()` (the provider has no session):

   ```go
   r.Handle("POST /api/v1/webhooks/payments", webhook.Stripe("PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET", handlers.PaymentEvent))
   r.Handle("POST /api/v1/webhooks/mail", webhook.Mailgun("MAIL_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY", handlers.MailEvent))
   ```

   Other providers: `webhook.HMAC("NAME", "X-Hub-Signature-256", h,
   webhook.Prefix("sha256="), webhook.IDHeader("X-GitHub-Delivery"))`
   for an HMAC-SHA256 of the body in a header (`webhook.Base64()` when
   it is base64); `webhook.Token("NAME", "Authorization", h,
   webhook.Prefix("Bearer "))` or `webhook.TokenField("NAME",
   "auth.token", h)` for a shared token in a header or a JSON field.
   A token does not cover the body: use it only when the provider
   offers nothing better. Stripe and Mailgun sign a timestamp, and a
   delivery more than 5 minutes off is refused (`webhook.Tolerance`);
   the body is capped at 1 MB (`webhook.MaxBody`, raise it for inbound
   mail with attachments) and the handler has 10 seconds
   (`webhook.Timeout`).
3. Write the handler in `handlers/webhooks.go`:

   ```go
   func PaymentEvent(ctx context.Context, d *webhook.Delivery) error {
   	ev, err := d.StripeEvent()
   	if err != nil {
   		return err
   	}
   	switch ev.Type {
   	case "checkout.session.completed":
   		var s struct {
   			ID        string `json:"id"`
   			Reference string `json:"client_reference_id"`
   		}
   		if err := json.Unmarshal(ev.Data.Object, &s); err != nil {
   			return err
   		}
   		return jobs.From(ctx).Enqueue(ctx, "order.paid", schema.OrderPaid{OrderID: s.Reference})
   	}
   	return nil // events the app ignores are acknowledged too
   }
   ```

   `d.Body` is the verified body, `d.Decode(&v)` decodes it,
   `d.MailgunEvent()` reads a mail event (`Event`, `Recipient`,
   `Severity`), `d.Form` holds a form post's fields. Returning nil
   replies 200; an error replies 500 and the provider retries. Keep
   the handler short and put slow work in a job.
4. Each delivery id (the event id, the mail token, the `IDHeader`) is
   handled once: a repeat replies 200 without calling the handler, and
   an id whose handler failed is handled again on the retry. The ids
   live in the `webhook_delivery` table when the db pack runs, kept
   for 30 days (`webhook.Retention`); with several nodes the db pack is
   required. Without it, dev and test keep them in memory and
   production refuses (503) unless `webhook.WithStore` names a store.
   The provider may still send two events about the same object, out
   of order: write with upserts keyed by the object's id.
5. Test it in `routes_test.go`, signing as the provider does:

   ```go
   func TestPaymentWebhook(t *testing.T) {
   	t.Setenv("PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET", "whsec_test")
   	srv := lidzatest.Start(t, app())
   	body := `{"id":"evt_1","type":"checkout.session.completed","data":{"object":{"id":"cs_1","client_reference_id":"42"}}}`
   	sig := webhook.StripeSignature("whsec_test", srv.Clock.Now(), []byte(body))
   	res := srv.JSON(t, "POST", "/api/v1/webhooks/payments", json.RawMessage(body), nil, lidzatest.Header("Stripe-Signature", sig))
   	if res.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
   		t.Fatal(res.StatusCode)
   	}
   }
   ```

   Keep the body compact and free of `<`, `>` and `&`: `srv.JSON`
   compacts and escapes a `json.RawMessage`, and the signature covers
   the exact bytes. `srv.Clock.Now()` signs at the app's time, so a
   test that moves the clock (`srv.Clock.Advance(10*time.Minute)`)
   sees an old delivery refused. Also check a wrong secret gets 401. `webhook.MailgunSignature(key, t, token)`
   builds the mail provider's `signature` object, `webhook.HMACSignature`
   an HMAC header's value.
6. By hand against `lidza dev`, sign with the dev secret:

   ```sh
   body='{"id":"evt_local_1","type":"ping"}'; t=$(date +%s)
   sig=$(printf '%s.%s' "$t" "$body" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "whsec_..." -r | cut -d' ' -f1)
   curl -si http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/webhooks/payments -H "Stripe-Signature: t=$t,v1=$sig" -d "$body"
   ```

   A provider's CLI that forwards its sandbox events (`stripe listen
   --forward-to 127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/webhooks/payments`) prints the
   secret to seal as `dev.PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
7. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Connect an external account

Let a signed-in user connect an account of another service (a code
host's repositories, a calendar, a storage service) so the server calls
its API as that user. This is not sign-in: the account opens no
session. The auth pack keeps the grant, its tokens sealed with the
master key in `auth_connection`, renews it, and never sends a token to
the browser.

1. Register an OAuth app with the provider. For GitHub: an OAuth App
   whose callback URL is `<APP_URL>/api/v1/auth` (GitHub accepts any
   redirect under it, so it serves sign-in with GitHub too) or exactly
   `<APP_URL>/api/v1/auth/connect/github/callback`. Seal its keys per
   mode and name it: `lidza credentials set
   dev.AUTH_CONNECT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=... dev.AUTH_CONNECT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...`
   (the production app's under `production.`), and `AUTH_CONNECT=github`
   in `.env` and `lidza.json`'s `deploy.env`. The default scopes are
   `repo admin:repo_hook` (repositories, private ones included, and
   their webhooks); `AUTH_CONNECT_GITHUB_SCOPES` asks for others. A
   grant missing a scope is refused and withdrawn.
2. Other providers go in the options, in `routes.go`:

   ```go
   auth.Mount(r, auth.Options{Connectors: []auth.Connector{
   	auth.GitHubConnect(id, secret),
   	auth.OAuth2Connect(auth.OAuth2Config{Name: "calendar", ClientID: cid, ClientSecret: csecret,
   		AuthURL: "https://provider.example/oauth/authorize", TokenURL: "https://provider.example/oauth/token",
   		RevokeURL: "https://provider.example/oauth/revoke", UserURL: "https://provider.example/oauth/userinfo",
   		Scopes: []string{"calendar.read"}, PKCE: true}),
   }})
   ```

   `Options.ConnectAuthorize` may refuse a user starting one (a plan,
   a workspace role).
3. The page links to `/api/v1/auth/connect/github/start?redirect=/settings`
   (a plain link, not a fetch: the browser goes to the provider and
   back). It lands on the redirect with `?connected=github`, or with
   `?connect_error=<reason>&provider=github` (denied, state, scopes,
   refused, provider). `GET /api/v1/auth/connections` lists the user's
   connections (provider, account, scopes, `reconnect` when the grant
   stopped working), never a token; `DELETE
   /api/v1/auth/connections/github` revokes the grant at the provider
   and forgets it.
4. On the server, call the API as the user:

   ```go
   conn, err := auth.From(ctx).Connection(ctx, auth.CurrentUser(ctx).ID, "github")
   if errors.Is(err, auth.ErrNotConnected) || errors.Is(err, auth.ErrReconnect) {
   	return out, router.Errorf(http.StatusConflict, "connect GitHub first")
   }
   res, err := conn.Client().Get("https://api.github.com/user/repos")
   ```

   `Client` sends the token and renews an expiring one (at most 8
   renewals at once per node, 15 seconds each; concurrent callers
   share one). A refused renewal is `auth.ErrReconnect`: the user
   connects again. The owner is always the app's decision: the
   signed-in user, or one an app's own check allows (a workspace's
   connection used by its members). A job takes the owner in its
   payload, never a token.
5. A GitHub App installation token is the narrower alternative for
   repositories (chosen repositories, fine-grained permissions, an hour
   each): the app mints those itself; they are not a user's connection.
6. `lidza gen` (and so `lidza update`) adds the `AuthConnection` model
   to an app from before connections; then `lidza db migrate`.
   Test with a fake provider (`httptest.NewServer`) and
   `auth.OAuth2Connect` pointed at it.

### Add a paginated, filterable list

Give a list search, filters, a date range, sorting and pages, so no page
shows an endless table.

1. `lidza gen resource <Model>` writes it for a model: the list route
   reads its parameters with `list.Read` (`pkg/list`) and the queries
   search the model's text fields, filter on its enums, booleans and
   references, bound its time (`createdAt` first), sort by its plain
   fields (newest first by default), and count the same rows. For a
   list of your own, the same: `p, err := list.Read(req,
   list.Options{Sorts: []string{"createdAt", "title"}, Desc: true,
   Filters: []string{"status"}})` (an unknown sort or a bad date is a
   422 naming the parameter), and the SQL in `db/queries/<table>.sql`
   as the generator writes it: `sqlc.narg('q')` and the filters `NULL`
   for none, `position(lower(...))` for the search (a `%` is just a
   character), one `CASE` per sort key in `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT
   sqlc.arg('lim')::int OFFSET sqlc.arg('off')::int`, and a `Count*`
   query with the same conditions.
2. The query string: `limit` (50, at most 200), `offset`, `q`, `since`
   and `until` (instants; until is exclusive), `sort`, `order` (`asc`,
   `desc`), and one parameter per filter.
3. The page (react template), from `src/list.tsx`: `useListState({
   filters: ['status'] })` keeps the state in the address,
   `api.listPosts({ query: listQuery(state) })` sends it (the date
   inputs' days become instants in the visitor's zone, until the end of
   the last day), and `ListToolbar` (the search, the range labelled by
   its field, the filters in one row), `FilterSelect` ("Status: Draft"),
   `SortHead` and `Pager` ("51–100 of 230") draw it. A list already in
   the browser pages with `pageRows(rows, state)`.
4. Test the route with `lidzatest`: a search, a filter, a range, a sort
   both ways and the last page, and a 422 for an unknown sort.

### Dates and time zones

Store instants in UTC, keep calendar days as days, and show both in the
visitor's language and zone.

1. Pick the field type in `schema.lidza`:
   - `time` is an instant (`timestamptz`): a post's `createdAt`, a
     meeting's start. JSON carries it in UTC, `"2026-10-06T14:30:00Z"`.
   - `date` is a calendar day with no zone (`date`, Go `civil.Date`): a
     birthday, a due date, a booking night. JSON carries
     `"2026-10-06"`, which no client shifts to another day.
   - `localtime` (API types only) is a date and time as a person typed
     it, with no zone: what `<input type="datetime-local">` sends,
     `"2026-10-06T10:30"`. The handler turns it into the instant:

     ```go
     start, skipped := i18n.From(ctx).At(ctx, req.Body.StartAt)
     if skipped { // 02:30 on the night clocks jump to 03:00 is 03:30
     	return out, router.Errorf(http.StatusUnprocessableEntity, "that time does not exist there; it would be %s", i18n.From(ctx).Time(ctx, start))
     }
     ```

2. The zone is the request's: the `i18n` pack reads the `tz` cookie the
   page sets from the browser, or `X-Timezone` from other clients, with
   `I18N_TIMEZONE` as the default. An app that stores a user's zone (a
   `zone string @timezone` field on its profile) applies it in its own
   middleware after sign-in, `ctx = i18n.WithTimezone(ctx, loc)` (with
   `loc, _ := time.LoadLocation(profile.Zone)`), and jobs and mail do the
   same with the user's stored zone, since they run outside a request.
   The zone data is built into the binary.
3. On the server: `i18n.From(ctx).Today(ctx)` is today in that zone,
   `Date`, `Time` and `DateTime` format an instant in it, `Relative` says
   "3 hours ago". `civil.Date` has `AddDays`, `DaysUntil`, `Before`,
   `In(loc)` (the start of that day there); compare instants as
   `time.Time` in UTC, and read the time with `lidza.Now(ctx)` so a test
   can set it.
4. In pages, `src/datetime.ts`: `formatDate`, `formatTime`,
   `formatDateTime`, `formatRelative` in the page's language and the
   visitor's zone (`setTimeZone(user.zone)` for a stored one),
   `toLocalInput(instant)` to fill a datetime-local input, `today()` for
   a date input. Format after the page loads, never while it is
   prerendered.
5. Test the edges with a fixed clock (`srv.Clock` in `lidzatest`) and a
   zone with daylight saving (`America/New_York`): the day after 23:00,
   the night the clocks change, a date near midnight UTC.

### Roles and permissions

Let the app decide who may do what, per team, beyond signed in or not.
The roles and their permissions are the app's, in code; who holds a
role, and in which team, is in the auth pack's `auth_member` table.

1. Define the roles once, in the app package:

   ```go
   var roles = auth.Roles{
   	"admin":  {"*"},
   	"editor": {"posts.*", "members.read"},
   	"viewer": {"posts.read", "members.read"},
   }
   ```

   A permission is a name (`posts.write`), `prefix.*` for every name
   under it, or `*`. A role the map no longer names grants nothing.
2. Guard routes with a permission in the request's scope (a team, a
   workspace; whatever the app groups by):

   ```go
   team := func(r *http.Request) string { return r.PathValue("team") }
   g := r.Group("/api/v1/teams/{team}/posts", roles.Require("posts.read", team))
   router.Route(r, "POST /api/v1/teams/{team}/posts", createPost, roles.Require("posts.write", team))
   ```

   `Require` signs the request in like `auth.Require()` and replies 401
   without a session, 403 without the permission, 500 when the check
   cannot run: it never lets a request through on an error. Inside a
   handler or a job, `roles.Check(ctx, team, "posts.publish")` returns
   nil, `auth.ErrForbidden` (a 403 from a typed handler) or the error.
3. Grant and revoke from the app's own team routes, guarded by a
   permission of their own (`members.manage`):

   ```go
   err := roles.Grant(ctx, subject, team, "editor") // idempotent; the granter is recorded
   err = roles.Revoke(ctx, subject, team, "editor")
   err = roles.RevokeAll(ctx, subject, team)          // a member leaving the team
   ```

   `auth.AppWide` ("") as the scope holds in every team: the app's own
   operators. `roles.Of(ctx, subject, team)` lists a user's roles there,
   `roles.Scopes(ctx, subject)` the teams they belong to,
   `roles.Members(ctx, team, cursor, limit)` a team's members a page at
   a time.
4. Every check reads the database: a revoked role, or a deleted
   account (whose memberships go with it), is refused on its next
   request even with a session still valid. Keep the first operator in
   `ADMIN_USERS` or grant them `admin` app-wide at setup.
5. `lidza gen` (and so `lidza update`) adds the `AuthMember` model to an
   app from before roles; then `lidza db migrate`. Test each role
   against each route with `lidzatest`: a viewer cannot write, an editor
   cannot manage members, another team's admin gets 403.

### Record an audit event

Keep a durable record of who did what, for operators and compliance:
`lidza pack add audit` (it needs the db pack; the actor comes from the
auth pack).

1. Record after the action, with the outcome:

   ```go
   err := audit.From(ctx).Record(ctx, audit.Event{
   	Action: "post.publish", Resource: "post/" + id, Scope: team,
   	Meta: map[string]string{"version": v},
   })
   ```

   The actor is the signed-in user (`auth.CurrentUser`), never a value
   from the request; a job names itself with `audit.System(ctx,
   "nightly-export")`. `Outcome` is `audit.OK` (the default),
   `audit.Denied` or `audit.Failed`: record refusals too. `Record`
   returns the database's error: an action that must be audited fails
   with it. `RecordTx(ctx, tx, e)` writes inside the change's
   transaction, so both commit or neither does.
2. Metadata is up to 20 short strings the app chose. A key named like
   a secret (`password`, `token`, `key`, `secret`, `cookie`...) or a
   value shaped like one (an API key, a token, a database URL with its
   password) is stored as `[redacted]`. Never pass a request body or
   an environment value.
3. Read it a page at a time, newest first:

   ```go
   page, err := audit.From(ctx).List(ctx, audit.Query{Scope: team, Limit: 50, Cursor: cursor})
   // page.Records, then page.Next as the next Cursor ("" at the end)
   ```

   Filter by `Actor`, `Action`, `Resource`, `Outcome`, `Since` and
   `Until`. Serve it behind a permission (`roles.Require("audit.read",
   team)`).
4. `AUDIT_RETENTION` (a year by default) prunes older records at start
   and daily; `0` keeps them. With the admin pages mounted, every admin
   action is recorded too (`admin.form`, `admin.download`).
5. `lidza gen` and `lidza db migrate` create `audit_event`.

### Add the admin pages

Give operators a place to watch the packs and set their providers,
without writing a page.

1. `lidza pack add auth` if the app has no accounts yet; the pages are
   behind `auth.Require()`.
2. In `routes.go`: `admin.Mount(r, admin.Options{Title: "thura"})`
   (import `github.com/agim/lidza/packs/admin`). Once `admin/` holds a
   file (the theme of step 5, a page template), embed it so the binary
   carries it and needs no `admin/` folder beside it: `//go:embed admin`
   above `var adminFiles embed.FS`, and `Templates:
   lidza.Sub(adminFiles, "admin")` in the options.
3. Sign in first: the first account is an admin. More are added on the
   Overview page, or from the project with `lidza admin add
   you@example.com` (`ADMIN_USERS` in the credentials, read within
   seconds). `.env.test` names a test account. A script or browser test
   run against `lidza dev` signs up in the dev database: its account may
   be the first, so add the developer with `lidza admin add`.
4. Each pack's page has a Settings tab (Mail, Language model, Storage;
   sign-in providers under Users): pick the provider and only its
   fields show. Values are saved sealed with the master key and applied
   without a restart; one set in the process environment wins and the
   field says so.
5. Theme it when the app has a look: `admin/theme.css` sets
   `--admin-accent`, `--admin-accent-fg`, `--admin-bg`, `--admin-surface`,
   `--admin-line`, `--admin-fg`, `--admin-muted`, `--admin-sidebar`,
   `--admin-font` and `--admin-radius`, per theme under
   `[data-bs-theme=light]` and `[data-bs-theme=dark]`, or any Tabler
   variable. The default is Līdza's palette (a mulberry accent on warm
   neutrals); match the app's own tokens instead of a stock blue. The
   file is read from `Options.Templates` (embedded, step 2), else from
   `admin/` on disk.
6. Test it: an admin gets 200 on `/admin/`, another user 403, a visitor
   401; the reference app's `routes_test.go` shows it.
7. `lidza check`, then `lidza test`.

### Extend the admin pages

Give the app's own operations a page in the admin pages (orders to
refund, a moderation queue, a report), or its own keys a settings form,
instead of a separate admin screen.

1. Settings: add an `admin.Section` to `admin.Options.Sections` for the
   keys the app reads with `pkg/env` (a payment provider's secret, a
   feature switch). Each `admin.Field` names its environment variable;
   `Kind` is `text`, `number`, `secret`, `select` or `multi`; a
   `Selector` field with `For` on the others shows only the fields of
   the chosen provider. They appear on the Settings page, saved like
   the packs'. A service that holds the value implements
   `Reconfigure(ctx) error` to pick up a saved change.
2. A page: add an `admin.Page` to `admin.Options.Pages` from a function
   in `handlers/admin.go` (snippet `admin-page`): `Name`, `Path`
   (`orders` serves `/admin/orders`), an `Icon` from the admin pack's
   `assets/icons.txt`, `Template`, `Data` (sqlc queries; the page is
   admin-only, so a query may cross accounts) and `Actions` (a form
   posts to `<Path>/<action>`; return the message the page shows, or an
   error). A form inside a detail view (`?order=1001`) adds
   `<input type="hidden" name="back" value="{{$.Back}}">` so
   its action returns to that view. A page that takes files sets
   `MaxUpload` (bytes) and its form `enctype="multipart/form-data"`; the
   action reads `r.MultipartForm.File`. A file to download (an export, an
   attachment) is a `Downloads` handler at `<Path>/<name>`, behind the
   same gate; it sets `Content-Disposition` and
   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. A staff audit log is
   `admin.Options.OnAudit(ctx, admin.Audit{Path, Form, Message, Error,
   Download, Status, Request})`: it runs after every form on every page
   (the pack's own and the app's) and every download, with secret
   values already redacted; insert a row with the admin
   (`auth.CurrentUser(ctx)`), and the action needs no audit code of its
   own.
3. The template is `admin/<page>.html` defining `content` (snippet
   `admin-page-template`): Tabler's classes (`card`, `table card-table`,
   `badge`, `btn`), the functions `icon`, `since`, `num`, `bytes`,
   `dict`, and `{{template "admin-empty" (dict "Icon" "inbox"
   "Title" "..." "Text" "...")}}` for an empty list. Embed it so it
   ships in the binary: `//go:embed admin` in `routes.go` and
   `Templates: lidza.Sub(adminFiles, "admin")` (the folder, so the
   theme ships too). No inline `<script>` or
   `style=`: the pages hold under a strict Content-Security-Policy; a
   destructive form takes `data-admin-confirm="..."`.
4. Record it in the same commit: `lidza decision add "Admin page
   Orders" --why "..."` (MCP `lidza_decision_add`), naming what the page
   lets an admin do and which rows it reaches across accounts.
5. Test it: the page answers 200 with a row for an admin and 403 for
   another user; the action changes the row (post the form with
   `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`, as a browser does). `lidza check`,
   then `lidza test`.

### Add a recipe

Record a convention of this app so the next task follows it: a pattern
used twice (how lists paginate, how ownership is checked, how a webhook
is verified, how a report is built) is a recipe.

1. `lidza recipe add "Paginate a list"` appends a skeleton under "App
   recipes" in `docs/lidza-guide.md` (or write the `###` section by hand;
   from an agent, the MCP tool `lidza_recipe_add` takes the title,
   description and steps).
2. Fill it in: one sentence on when it applies, then numbered steps that
   name the file to open, the function or type to use, the command to
   run, and the check at the end. Point at a file in this app that does
   it already.
3. `lidza gen` (or the next check) turns it into the prompt, the skills
   and the command, and lists it in `AGENTS.md`. Restart `lidza mcp` to see the new prompt.

### Write a test

Cover a handler with a Go test that boots the app, or a page with a
browser test.

1. Handler: in `routes_test.go` (or `handlers/<name>_test.go`):

   ```go
   func TestCreateThing(t *testing.T) {
   	srv := lidzatest.Start(t, app())
   	var out schema.Thing
   	res := srv.JSON(t, "POST", "/api/v1/things", schema.CreateThing{Title: "x"}, &out)
   	if res.StatusCode != http.StatusCreated || out.Title != "x" {
   		t.Fatalf("%d %+v", res.StatusCode, out)
   	}
   }
   ```

   `lidzatest.Start` boots the app with its packs (`.env.test`,
   `LIDZA_MODE=test`); `srv.JSON(t, method, path, body, &out,
   lidzatest.Bearer(token))` calls it. Freeze time with `srv.Clock.Set(t)`
   when the handler uses `lidza.Now(ctx)`; replay outbound HTTP with
   `lidzatest.WithRecorder("name")` when it uses `lidza.HTTPClient(ctx)`
   (recorded once with `LIDZA_RECORD=1 lidza test`).
2. Run `lidza test` (MCP: `lidza_test`): it creates and migrates the
   test database, runs `go test ./...`, then the frontend check.
3. Page: in `e2e/<name>.spec.ts` (Playwright) load the page, assert on
   text or roles, and assert no `window` errors (see `e2e/home.spec.ts`).
   Run `lidza test --e2e` (add `--install` once if the browser is
   missing).

### Organize application packages

Place app-owned Go code consistently as the app grows; preserve generated
contracts and keep the same instructions available to every agent.

1. Read the brief, decisions and layout in this guide. With `appDir`, keep
   the application factory, routes, startup, tools and embedded assets there;
   `main.go` stays the entrypoint. Keep HTTP and job handlers in `handlers/`,
   where `lidza gen resource` writes them. Integration tests live in `tests/`
   when the app has an importable factory; unit tests stay beside their package.
2. Put business behavior in `internal/<feature>/` (for example
   `internal/orders/`), vendor clients in `internal/providers/<vendor>/` and
   shared infrastructure in `internal/platform/<name>/`. Create packages as
   features need them. Go enforces the `internal` import boundary. An app that
   needs a reusable public library should extract a separate module.
3. Declare models, API shapes and enums in `schema.lidza`. Write SQL in
   `db/queries/*.sql`. Keep generated `schema/`, `db/queries/gen/`, pack wrappers
   and `.lidza/` at their existing paths. Handwritten behavior belongs with its
   feature; do not introduce a second models folder or edit generated structs.
4. Wire services in the startup hook and pass dependencies through the existing
   services registry or constructors. Feature and provider packages do not
   import the application factory or its handlers. Avoid import cycles and
   keep the scalability rules, deadlines and test stubs.
5. For existing code, move files with `git mv`, preserve tests and assertions,
   update imports and current documentation references, and carry embedded
   assets and package-relative fixtures with their package. Keep historical
   migration source references unchanged. Run `lidza gen` afterwards.
6. Shared rules, agreements and notes go in `AGENTS.md`, the one
   instructions file (`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` import it). Edit recipes
   in this guide; `lidza gen` updates both agents' skills and Gemini
   commands.
7. Record the layout decision in `docs/decisions.md`. Verify discovery with
   `lidza api --list` and `lidza api ./internal/orders --filter Name` for a
   real package and declaration. App internal packages are discoverable through
   CLI and MCP; framework internals are not an app API.
8. Run `lidza check`, `lidza test` and `lidza verify`. Run the browser suite
   for an application move that changes its wiring or embedded assets.

## App recipes

This app's own conventions, one recipe each; the framework never edits
this section. Add one with `lidza recipe add "Title"` or by hand (see
"Add a recipe").

## Packs

A pack is Rust compiled to WASM, run by the app in a bounded pool with a
deadline per call. `pack.lidza.json` lists its capabilities; each names an
input and an output type from `schema.lidza`. `lidza gen` writes
`packs/<name>/pack.go`, so from a handler:

```go
out, err := geo.From(ctx).GeoDistance(ctx, req.Body)
```

To add one, follow the recipe "Add a pack capability". `lidza dev`
rebuilds the module when the crate changes.

The official `media` pack (`lidza pack add media`) reads an image's size
and format (`ImageInfo`) and resizes it (`ImageResize`) to jpeg, png or
webp. `Fit` picks how: `contain` (the default) scales it inside
`Width` by `Height`, never enlarged; `cover` fills exactly that size and
crops the overflow around the centre, for square avatars and thumbnails.
It decodes jpeg, png, webp, gif and bmp. HEIC (what phones take), AVIF
and TIFF fail with the code `unsupported_format`: there is no mature
pure-Rust HEIC decoder and the pack takes no C library, so the app keeps
the original file:

```go
out, err := media.From(ctx).ImageResize(ctx, schema.ImageResizeInput{Data: data, Width: &size, Height: &size, Fit: &cover})
if engine.ErrorCode(err) == "unsupported_format" {
	// store the original as it is; no thumbnail
}
```

## Rust: when and how

Go first. Handlers, queries, jobs, anything that talks to the database,
the network or the file system is Go, and stays Go. Rust is the compute
plane, reached only through a pack, and it is not there for speed: the
WASM sandbox costs more than it saves on this kind of work.

Measured (`go test ./pkg/engine -bench .` in the framework, one core of
an Intel Xeon E5-2407 v2, wazero 1.12, opt-level 3; treat as orders of
magnitude):

| | Go | Rust pack, `uninterruptible` | Rust pack, default |
|---|---|---|---|
| boundary: call with 100 B of JSON | | 12 µs | 44 µs |
| boundary: 1 MB of JSON | | 15 ms | 129 ms |
| brute-force nearest neighbours, 2000×500 points | 4.1 ms | 11.5 ms | 56 ms |
| word frequencies over 200 KB of text | 10.3 ms | 16.5 ms | 91 ms |

So reach for a pack when one of these is true, not otherwise:

1. **The code must be contained.** It transforms user-supplied input
   (images, documents, uploads, formulas) where a bug or a hostile input
   could loop, blow up memory or panic. A capability runs with a memory
   cap and a deadline; the worst case is one failed call, never a crashed
   process.
2. **A Rust crate does what you need** and Go has no equivalent worth
   the port: image codecs, geospatial indexes, parsers.
3. **The Go heap is the bottleneck**: a workload that allocates in the
   hundreds of megabytes and pins the garbage collector. The pack's
   memory is its own and freed as a block.

Not for: anything under a millisecond of work (the boundary costs more),
anything that needs I/O, or a hot path where the numbers above matter.
Measure with `lidza benchmark` before and after.

How, in short (the recipe "Add a pack capability" has the steps; the
snippets `pack-capability` and `pack-manifest` are working code):

- Types in `schema.lidza`; the capability in
  `packs/<name>/rust/src/lib.rs` as `lidza_export!`; the manifest lists
  it; the handler calls `<name>.From(ctx).<Capability>(ctx, in)`.
- Keep the input small and the output smaller: JSON crosses the boundary
  at roughly 70 MB/s. Send an id and let Go fetch, or send the bytes
  once, not per item.
- Set `"uninterruptible": true` in the manifest when every loop is
  bounded by the input (one pass over a text, over the pixels of an
  image, over a list): loops then run 3 to 8 times faster. Leave it off
  for code whose loops depend on the data's shape (parsers, solvers,
  anything recursive): the default inserts a deadline check in every
  loop, so a runaway call is cut off at `timeout_ms` instead of holding
  an instance until it returns.
- Errors: return `Err("message")` for input problems (the caller sees a
  400 with that text); panics are contained and reported as an error.
  To let the caller branch on the kind of failure, return
  `Result<Out, abi::Error>` and `Err(abi::Error::code("too_large",
  "..."))`; Go reads it with `engine.ErrorCode(err)`. A `String` error
  converts into one without a code, so `?` works on either.
- Never do I/O in Rust: the sandbox has no network and no file system,
  by design.

Official Go packs, configured from `.env` (see `.env.example` after
`lidza pack add`):

- `db`: `db.From(ctx)` is a `*pgxpool.Pool`; SQL in `db/queries/*.sql`
  becomes typed Go via sqlc (`queries.New(db.From(ctx)).Name(ctx, ...)`).
- `auth`: `auth.HashPassword`/`CheckPassword`; `auth.From(ctx).Login(ctx,
  userID, claims)` returns tokens, `req.SetCookie` each of
  `auth.From(ctx).Cookies(tokens)` for browsers; protect a group with
  `g := r.Group("/api/v1/notes", auth.Require())` and read
  `auth.CurrentUser(ctx)`; `auth.Optional()` for a route that serves
  visitors too (the user is nil then). Logout:
  `auth.From(ctx).Logout(ctx, user.SessionID)`. Delete an account and
  every row the pack keeps with `auth.From(ctx).DeleteUser(ctx, id)`
  (or `DeleteUserTx` in the app's transaction); with `auth.Mount`,
  `OnSignUp` and `OnDeleteUser` run the app's code in the same
  transactions (recipe "Add sign-in"). Sessions slide: when
  a browser's access token has expired, `Require` and `Optional` renew
  it from the refresh cookie on that request and set both cookies again,
  so a tab stays signed in for `AUTH_REFRESH_TTL` without a refresh
  route or client code; a bearer client refreshes through a route of the
  app that calls `auth.From(ctx).Refresh`. Without "remember me":
  `auth.From(ctx).LoginWith(ctx, userID, claims,
  auth.SessionOptions{SessionOnly: true})`; its cookies and every
  renewal's are session cookies, gone when the browser closes. Read what changes after login
  (a verified flag, a role) from the database, not from the token's
  claims, which are what they were at login. Hardening: wrap the
  credential routes with `auth.Throttle()` (per-client rate limit,
  `AUTH_LOGIN_RPS`) and the sign-in route with `auth.ThrottleSignIn()`
  (its own limit, `AUTH_SIGNIN_RPS`, else `AUTH_LOGIN_RPS`), refuse weak
  passwords with
  `auth.From(ctx).ValidatePassword(password, email)` (length, common
  passwords, the email itself), and run email verification and password
  reset on one-time tokens: `IssueToken(ctx, auth.PurposeVerifyEmail,
  email, 0)` makes the token the app mails, `ConsumeToken` redeems it
  once; `RevokeAll` after a reset. Working code: the snippets `routes`
  and `auth-handlers`.
- `jobs`: register handlers in `start.go` (`onStart`) with
  `jobs.FromServices(s).Handle("kind", fn)`; enqueue with
  `jobs.From(ctx).Enqueue(ctx, "kind", payload, jobs.RunAt(t))`, or
  `EnqueueTx(ctx, tx, ...)` inside a transaction; recurring work with
  `jobs.FromServices(s).Schedule("kind", jobs.Weekly(time.Monday,
  "09:00", "Europe/Tirane"), payload)` (or `jobs.Every(d)`,
  `jobs.Daily("06:30", zone)`), one job per due time across nodes. The
  handler's context carries the packs (`db.From(ctx)`, `mail.From(ctx)`)
  and is cancelled at shutdown after `JOBS_DRAIN`, the job going back to
  pending. Recipe: "Add a background job".
- `cache`: `cache.Remember(ctx, cache.From(ctx), "key", ttl, load)`;
  `cache.From(ctx).Invalidate(ctx, "prefix:")` after writes. Counters
  every node shares (a rate limit, a quota): `n, err :=
  cache.From(ctx).Incr(ctx, "rate:"+ip+":"+minute, 1, time.Minute)` adds
  atomically (a Lua script on Valkey) and returns the new value; the
  increment that creates the key sets the ttl, later ones keep it.
- `i18n`: `i18n.From(ctx).T(ctx, "key", args...)`, `Number`, `Currency`,
  `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime`, `Relative`, `Today` and `At` (a typed local
  time to its instant) in the visitor's zone (the template sets a `tz`
  cookie, API clients send `X-Timezone`; `I18N_TIMEZONE` is the default;
  recipe "Dates and time zones"); catalogs in `locales/<lang>.json` (nested keys join with
  dots); serve them to other clients with
  `r.Handle("GET /api/v1/i18n/{lang}", i18n.Handler())`. Store and send
  times in UTC; format at the edge. The mail pack writes in the
  request's locale (`mail/<name>.<lang>.txt.tmpl`). Pages (react and
  svelte templates) translate with `t('key', args...)`, `locale()` and
  `setLocale(lang)` from `src/i18n.ts`, over the same catalogs. With more than one catalog
  `npm run build` writes every prerendered page once per locale
  (`dist/.locales/<lang>/`, the `I18N_DEFAULT` one also at the plain
  path), and the binary serves the one the request negotiates (`?lang`,
  the `lang` cookie, `Accept-Language`, then `I18N_DEFAULT`) with
  `Vary: Accept-Language, Cookie`; the page carries `<html lang>` and its
  catalog, so nothing renders in another language first. `LIDZA_SSR=1`
  renders in the same locale; paths that are not prerendered get that
  locale's shell. `setLocale` sets the `lang` cookie and reloads. An app
  created before `src/i18n.ts` existed takes it, `scripts/` and the
  i18n lines of `src/main.*` and `src/entry-server.*` from a new app
  (`lidza new tmp --template react --no-setup`, or `svelte`). Recipe:
  "Add a page".
- `realtime`: `realtime.From(ctx).Publish(ctx, topic, value)` and
  `r.Handle("GET /api/v1/realtime", realtime.Handler(realtime.Authorize(fn)))`
  behind `auth.Require()`; `fn(r, topic)` decides per topic. Without it
  no topic can be subscribed; `realtime.Authorize(realtime.AllowAll)`
  opens every topic to every connection. Recipe: "Publish live
  updates".
- `mail`: `mail.From(ctx).Send(ctx, mail.Message{To, Subject, Template:
  "verify", Data: data})` renders `mail/verify.txt.tmpl` and
  `mail/verify.html.tmpl` (Go templates over `Data`; links through
  `mail.From(ctx).Link(path)`, absolute with `APP_URL`), or
  `mail/verify.<lang>.*` for the message's `Lang` or the request's
  language (`mail.Languages(ctx)`: the `i18n` locale, else
  `Accept-Language`), and delivers through
  `MAIL_PROVIDER` (`mailgun`, `sendgrid`, `postmark`, `resend`, `smtp`;
  `log` by default, `outbox` in tests). With the `db` pack every message
  is a row in `mail_message` (`Outbox(ctx, n)`, `WaitFor(ctx, to,
  subject, timeout)` in tests, the MCP tool `lidza_mail`); with the
  `jobs` pack delivery runs as a job with
  retries. Never import a vendor SDK (`lidza check` L006).
- `llm`: `llm.From(ctx).Chat(ctx, llm.Request{System: s, Messages:
  []llm.Message{ {Role: llm.User, Content: text} }})` returns `Text` and
  `Usage`; `Stream` delivers the text as it arrives; `llm.Generate[T]`
  sends T's JSON Schema (a `type` from `schema.lidza`) and validates the
  reply; `Run(ctx, req, tools())` offers the app's `lidza.Tool` values to
  the model and runs the calls it makes; `Embeddings(ctx,
  llm.EmbedRequest{Texts: texts, Label: "post.index"})` returns vectors
  and their tokens (`Embed(ctx, texts)` without a label). Providers
  spoken directly: `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `ollama` (local),
  `compatible` (any server speaking the OpenAI API), and `fake` for
  tests and a first run (`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_KEY`,
  `LLM_BASE_URL`). Embeddings use the chat provider unless
  `EMBED_PROVIDER` names another (`openai`, `google`, `ollama`,
  `compatible`, `fake`, or `none` for off; `EMBED_MODEL`,
  `EMBED_API_KEY`, `EMBED_BASE_URL`; `LLM_EMBED_MODEL` is still read
  when `EMBED_MODEL` is empty); Anthropic cannot embed, and Embed says
  to set `EMBED_PROVIDER`. With the db pack every chat and embedding is
  a row in `llm_usage` with its label and tokens. Every call has a
  deadline and retries on 429 and 5xx; tokens count on `/metrics`.
  Never import a vendor SDK or a client library (`lidza check` L007).
  Recipe: "Add an LLM feature".
- `storage`: `storage.From(ctx).Put(ctx, "avatars/"+id+".png", r,
  storage.PutOptions{})` stores a file (content type detected), `Get`,
  `Stat`, `List(ctx, prefix, n)`, `Delete`; `PresignGet(ctx, key, ttl)`
  and `PresignPut` give a browser a URL to read or upload directly,
  `URL(key)` the public address with `STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL`; mount
  `storage.Handler("/api/v1/files/")` behind `auth.Require()` to serve
  private objects through the app. Providers: `s3` (AWS S3, MinIO, R2,
  B2, Wasabi, Spaces: `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, the keys in
  the credentials) and `local` (a directory, for development and tests).
  In a bucket several apps share, `STORAGE_PREFIX=myapp` puts every key
  under `myapp/`; the app's keys never carry it (`Put(ctx,
  "avatars/1.png", ...)` stores `myapp/avatars/1.png`), and `List`,
  `Stat` and `Put` return keys without it.
  Never import a storage SDK (`lidza check` L008) and never write an
  upload or a generated file to the local disk (`os.WriteFile`, L009):
  a node's disk is neither shared nor kept. The MCP tool `lidza_storage`
  lists what is stored. Recipe: "Store a file".
- `admin`: `admin.Mount(r, admin.Options{Title: "thura"})` serves
  the admin pages at `/admin` for `ADMIN_USERS` (see "Admin pages").
- `analytics` (opt-in): server errors are captured on their own; register
  `r.Handle("POST /api/v1/analytics/{kind}", analytics.Handler())`, set
  `VITE_ANALYTICS=1`, and call `analytics.From(ctx).Track(ctx, "name",
  props)` or `track()` from `src/analytics.ts`. The MCP tool
  `lidza_errors` shows what broke.

Order in `lidza.json` matters: `lidza/db` before `lidza/auth` and
`lidza/jobs`.

## Flutter or other Dart clients

Set `"sdk": {"dart": "clients/dart"}` in `lidza.json`; `lidza gen` writes
the `lidza_client` Dart package there with the same operations as
`@lidza/client`.

## Admin pages

`admin.Mount(r, admin.Options{Title: "thura"})` in `routes.go` serves
`/admin` for the app's first account (the first user ever to sign in is
an admin; `Options.NoFirstUserAdmin` turns that off) and for the users
`ADMIN_USERS` names (ids or emails, comma separated, in `.env` or added
from the Overview page, which saves them sealed; `Options.Allow` for
another rule). The pages are built on Tabler, light and dark, with their
stylesheet, script and icons served from the binary:

- Overview: each pack's state, a checklist before production, admins.
- Users: every account that signed in, searchable, with sign out
  everywhere, disable, enable and admin rights; a Sign-in tab for the
  providers of `auth.Mount`.
- Mail, Language model, Storage: the outbox, token usage by day and
  label, stored files, each with a Settings tab whose fields follow the
  chosen provider (the Language model tab has two: the model provider,
  and Embeddings with its own).
- Jobs: counts by state, recent jobs, retry.
- The app's own pages (`Options.Pages`) and settings (`Options.Sections`,
  on a Settings page); recipe "Extend the admin pages".

Values saved there are sealed with the master key and applied without a
restart. Theme (read from `Options.Templates` when the app embeds
`admin/`, else from disk): `admin/theme.css` sets the `--admin-*` variables (accent,
background, surface, line, text, sidebar, font, radius; per theme) or any
Tabler variable; `admin/layout.html` replaces the frame (define `layout`,
call `{{template "admin-head" .}}` in `<head>`,
`{{template "admin-scripts" .}}` before `</body>`, and
`{{template "content" .}}` where the page goes). Recipes:
"Add the admin pages", "Extend the admin pages".

## Settings files

Settings are read in layers, each overriding the one before: `.env`,
then `.env.<mode>`, then the credentials, then the process environment.
The mode is `dev` under `lidza dev`, `test` under `lidza test` and
`production` otherwise. `.env` is shared by every mode, tests included,
so:

- a development-only setting (a real provider, a slow import, a
  verbose log) goes in `.env.dev`, never `.env`;
- a test setting goes in `.env.test`, which overrides `.env` (the fake
  model, local storage, the mail outbox, `CACHE_URL=memory`).

Tests never read the sealed credentials file: it holds the deployment's
real keys, and a test must not reach a real service with them. A test
that needs a key sets it with `t.Setenv` (against a stub) or in
`.env.test`; values the app saves at runtime (the admin pages) still
count.

`.env` and `.env.dev` stay out of git. `.env.test` is committed: it
holds no secrets, and the tests and CI need it. Its `DATABASE_URL`
names this machine's Postgres socket; `lidza gen`, `dev`, `test` and
`update` repair it on a machine that keeps the socket elsewhere, and
CI sets its own `DATABASE_URL`.

## Security headers

Every response carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy:
strict-origin-when-cross-origin` and `Permissions-Policy: camera=(),
microphone=(), geolocation=()`. `lidza.App` in `main.go` sets the rest:

- `CSP`: the Content-Security-Policy. Empty sends
  `middleware.DefaultCSP` everywhere but `lidza dev` (Vite's dev server
  injects inline scripts, so dev sends none): scripts, styles, fonts,
  fetches and WebSockets from the app's own origin only, images also from
  `data:` and `blob:`, no plugins, no framing, forms posting to the app.
  The built pages hold under it: the binary adds the hash of each inline
  script and `<style>` a page carries (the router's hydration payload) to
  the header it serves the page with, and JSON-LD from `Head` is data the
  policy does not govern. An app that loads from another origin (a
  script CDN, an image host, a payment form) extends the default rather
  than appending to it, since a browser keeps only the first of a
  repeated directive:
  `CSP: middleware.AddCSP(middleware.DefaultCSP, "script-src", "https://js.example.com")`,
  one call per directive. `middleware.NoCSP` sends none. Inline
  `<script>`, `style=` attributes and `on...=` handlers in hand-written
  HTML are refused; put the code in a file.
- `PermissionsPolicy`: replaces the default. A page that asks for the
  visitor's location (`navigator.geolocation`) needs
  `PermissionsPolicy: middleware.AllowGeolocation` (`geolocation=(self)`,
  camera and microphone still off); with the default the browser refuses
  without showing the prompt. Name any other feature the same way
  (`camera=(self)`) and keep the rest off.
- `HSTS`: the Strict-Transport-Security header. Empty sends
  `middleware.DefaultHSTS` (`max-age=31536000`: browsers keep to HTTPS
  for a year) wherever `APP_URL` is `https://` outside `lidza dev`, which
  `LIDZA_TLS_DOMAINS` sets, and a deploy behind a TLS proxy sets in its
  environment; nothing over HTTP. `middleware.HSTSSubdomains` covers
  every subdomain too: only when the app owns the whole domain.
  `middleware.NoHSTS` sends none.

## Secrets

Anything secret (API keys, SMTP URLs, storage keys, `AUTH_SECRET` in
production) lives in `config/credentials.yml.enc`, sealed with
AES-256-GCM under `config/master.key`, which git ignores. `lidza
credentials set MAIL_API_KEY=...` (MCP: `lidza_credentials_set`) seals a
value; `list` shows the names, `show` every value (`show NAME` one),
`edit` the whole file in `$EDITOR`. Every pack reads the credentials by the same names as
`.env`, between the `.env` files and the process environment, so nothing
in the code changes. A value for one mode only goes in that mode's
section: `lidza credentials set dev.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
production.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...` keeps the sandbox key for
`lidza dev` and the live one for production in the same file; a mode
reads the plain values and its section, which wins. The CLI reads as
`dev` (`lidza test` as `test`), so a production value never reaches a
development command. In production the key travels as
`LIDZA_MASTER_KEY` (the file's contents) and the sealed file is deployed
with the binary. A key, a token or a database URL with its password pasted into the Go or frontend source fails `lidza check` (L010). The admin pages save changes to the database, sealed
with the same key, and the mail, llm and storage packs pick them up
without a restart; settings a pack refuses are not kept. Saved values
win over the file: `list` and `show` include them, and `unset NAME`
clears one there too, the way out when a saved setting stops the app
from starting (the start error names them).

## Models and migrations

A `model` in `schema.lidza` is a table; a `type` is an API shape only;
an `enum Status { todo doing done }` is a Postgres enum type and a string
union in the clients. Field types: `string`, `text`, `int`, `bigint`,
`float`, `decimal(p, s)`, `bool`, `time`, `date`, `uuid`, `json`,
`bytes`, and in types only `localtime`; `?` makes a field optional (nullable), `[]` an array. Field
attributes: `@id`, `@default(uuid())` / `@default(now())` /
`@default(autoincrement())` / `@default(value)`, `@unique`,
`@index`, `@ref(Model)` for a foreign key, the field typed as the
model's id (`categoryId int @ref(Category)` when `Category` has
`id int @id`; `@ref(Model, cascade)` deletes the row with the
referenced one, `@ref(Model, setnull)` clears an optional field), `@min(n)` / `@max(n)` (length or value), `@email`,
`@url`, `@pattern("re")`, `@timezone` (an IANA zone name). Block attributes inside a model:
`@@unique(a, b)`, `@@index(a, b)`; `@table("name")` after the model name.

Numbered rows and exact amounts:

```
model Order {
  id         bigint         @id @default(autoincrement())
  customerId bigint         @ref(Customer)
  total      decimal(12, 2) @min(0) @max(99999999.99)
  discount   decimal(5, 4)?
}
```

- `@default(autoincrement())` on an `int` or `bigint` is a Postgres
  identity column (`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`): the database
  numbers the rows, inserts leave it out (the resource generator does),
  and a `@ref` to the model uses the id's type (`bigint` here). Turning
  an existing column into one moves the sequence past its largest value.
- `decimal(p, s)` is `numeric(p,s)`: `p` digits in all, `s` after the
  point, so `decimal(12, 2)` holds up to 9999999999.99. Use it for money
  and quantities, never `float`. In Go it is `decimal.Decimal`
  (`github.com/agim/lidza/pkg/decimal`), a string-backed type: the value
  stays the text Postgres sent, "12.50", with no float rounding, and
  JSON carries it as a string. A literal converts (`Total: "12.50"`);
  outside text goes through `decimal.Parse`; `Cmp` compares exactly;
  arithmetic goes through `math/big` (`d.Rat()`, then
  `decimal.FromRat(r, 2)`, which rounds half away from zero like
  Postgres). It is a type of the lidza module rather than a third-party
  decimal library because the module has none and the framework only
  needs exact transport, comparison and validation; an app that does
  heavy arithmetic converts at the edge. `lidza gen` maps sqlc's numeric
  to the same type in `sqlc.yaml` (between `# lidza gen` comments), so
  `db/queries/gen` and `schema/` agree. pgx reads a zero as `0` whatever
  its scale; every other value keeps its trailing zeros.
- `Validate` checks that a decimal fits its column (rule `decimal`: no
  more digits than `p` and `s` allow, which Postgres would round or
  refuse) and applies `@min` and `@max` exactly, as decimals.
- In TypeScript a decimal is a `string` ("12.50"); `validators.ts`
  applies the same rules with BigInt, never a float. Show it with
  `Number(v).toLocaleString(undefined, { minimumFractionDigits: 2 })` or
  `Intl.NumberFormat(..., { style: 'currency', currency })` for display
  only; send it back as the string the user typed or the server sent,
  and do arithmetic on the server. Dart and Rust carry it as `String`.

Go names follow the field names with initialisms in capitals and their
plurals with a lowercase s: `authorId` is `AuthorID`, `url` is `URL`,
`tagIds` is `TagIDs`. sqlc follows the same rule in
`db/queries/gen`, so a field has the same name in both, and its struct
and enum names come from the table and type names the same way
(`api_key` is `APIKey`): `lidza gen` keeps the initialisms and
renames in `sqlc.yaml` between two `# lidza gen` comments.

`lidza gen` writes the full DDL to
`db/schema.sql` and, when models changed since `db/schema.lock.json`, a
pair in `db/migrations/` named by the UTC time it was written
(`20261006140512_create_post.up.sql`, `.down.sql`), always after the
newest one there; migrations of older releases (`0105_x`) keep their
numbers and sort first. Two branches that each change the schema write
two names, never one, and both apply after the merge.
Statements that lose data or can fail on existing rows carry a
`-- review` comment. Applying migrations is the `db` pack's job.

A step the schema cannot say (a data backfill, a hand-tuned index) is a
migration of its own, never SQL appended to a generated file:
`lidza db new "backfill post slugs"` (MCP `lidza_db_new`) writes an empty
pair named after the newest migration, which `lidza gen` never touches;
write its SQL, then `lidza db migrate`. Make a backfill safe to run
twice (`UPDATE post SET slug = ... WHERE slug IS NULL`).
## Operations

The binary serves `/healthz` (liveness), `/readyz` (503 while a pack's
check fails: database ping, bus) and `/metrics` (Prometheus: requests by
route pattern, durations, pool and connection gauges). In dev,
`/debug/pprof/` too. `lidza check` has rules of its own: package-level
maps or slices (L001) and goroutines started in handlers (L002), because
state belongs in Postgres or Valkey and background work in a bounded
worker or the jobs pack; hand-written `fetch` of `/api` (L003); imports
of packages that do not exist or are not declared (L004); handler types
not declared in `schema.lidza` (L005); a call whose error is dropped, as
a statement or assigned to `_` (L016: handle it or return it; deferred
calls, a `Close` before a `return`, printing to the terminal and writes
to a buffer or a hash are exempt); and a run of at least 8 statements
that repeats another in the app, names and literals aside (L017: reuse
the first or extract a function both call). `// lidza:ignore L016` on
the line, or the line before, exempts one call; above a function,
`// lidza:ignore L017` exempts the function.
Rate limit a route group with `r.Use(middleware.RateLimit(middleware.RateLimitOptions{RPS: 10, Burst: 20}))`
(per node; a limit across nodes counts with the cache pack's `Incr`);
guard an outbound dependency with `resilience.New(...)`.

## Deployment

`lidza build` makes `bin/thura`: the frontend embedded, no Node at
runtime (except `LIDZA_SSR=1`), with a Brotli and a gzip copy of each
compressible file it serves to browsers that accept one (pages built
per request are gzipped as they go out; `docs/deploy.md` has the
details and the proxy alternative). `Dockerfile` builds the same into an
image that runs as a non-root user on port 3000 (the binary, `db/`,
`mail/`, `admin/` and the sealed credentials; the master key comes from
`LIDZA_MASTER_KEY` in the environment, and the local storage provider
needs a volume at `STORAGE_DIR`, so production uses `s3`); `deploy/thura.service`
runs the binary under systemd from `/opt/thura` (install commands in
its header). Migrations ship as files in `db/`: apply them with `lidza db
migrate --production` in the deploy step or `DB_MIGRATE=true` at start. `lidza ship
--domains app.example.com` records the domain in `lidza.json` and writes
`deploy/production.env`, the environment of the deployed process
(plus `DATABASE_URL` and `LIDZA_MASTER_KEY`). TLS: with
`LIDZA_TLS_DOMAINS=app.example.com` the binary serves HTTPS on 443
itself with Let's Encrypt certificates, renewed on its own and stored
in Postgres through the db pack so every node shares them, and
redirects 80; `APP_URL` and `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` follow from it. Needs
a DNS record for the domain and ports 80 and 443 open (`lidza doctor`
checks both). Hostnames the app learns while it runs (a customer's own
domain) are approved by `App.TLSHosts` (`func(ctx, host) error`, nil
approves): asked in the handshake, the ACME challenges and before every
certificate order, cached per node (an approval 5 minutes, a refusal 1
minute), so a host it stops approving is refused and never renewed. An
approved host reaches the whole app: serve its paths with `r.Mount`
(outside `/api`) and keep the rest to the app's domains with a
middleware on `r.Host`. The admin overview lists the certificates and
the latest refusals. Or put a TLS-terminating proxy in front and forward
`X-Forwarded-For`. Point the orchestrator at `/healthz` and `/readyz`,
scrape `/metrics`. Production settings: `LIDZA_MODE` unset,
`LIDZA_LOG=json`, `AUTH_SECRET` the same on every node. The framework's
`docs/deploy.md` has the details.

## Environment the binary reads

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `LIDZA_ADDR` | listen address (ignored when TLS is on) | `127.0.0.1:3000` |
